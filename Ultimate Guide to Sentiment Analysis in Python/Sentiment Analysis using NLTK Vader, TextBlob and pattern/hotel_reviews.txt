	Nice Hotel...Great Location	Stayed here for my 40th B-Day. Got Studio King Suite for great rate. Very nice and big room, hardwood floors and balcony. Comfortable bed and great shower pressure. 2 elevators in hotel, one was big and the other was barely enough for 2 people with luggage. Bellman and Front desk staff were great and helpfull. Food, Starbucks, train, Whole Foods, Central Park all within steps of hotel. Overall this is great hotel and plan on staying here again in the future.
Nov 9 2009	great hotel great service!	We stayed one night to celebrate a special birthday. We were surprised by an upgrade to a penthouse suite due to a cancellation! The suite was amazing! Clean, very spacious, nice amentities. Everything we could need and if not, the staff was always willing to help with anything you would want or need. The location was awesome, across the street from Central Park and Time Warner Bldg.The staff at 6 Columbus was young, attentive, courteous, friendly,more than helpful, and very professional. The staff at the hotel made our visit better than expected and we will definately return.We didn't try the hotel restaurant but did have room service-continental breakfast and it was on time, and very satisfying. Great place to start and end your visit in NYC.There is a store right at the corner if you forgot anything or want cold drinks/snacks/etc.
Nov 1 2009 	really nice hotel	i stayed here for one night. we haggled the price for the room and he put it down by about 60$ . the hotel room is lovely. we got a king room.really clean and big.. loads of room. big bathroom with bath. very comfortable bed. tv ipod dock wardrobe. would recommend this hotel. nice and quiet. reception wer really nice. its a small hotel but conteporary design! but great room.we had breakfast the next morning in the restaurant and was really nice. great location
Oct 21 2009 	Friendly staff and great location	While the contemporary-styled standard rooms here are small and lack the chairs, desk and dressers one might expect, the hotel makes up for it with a perfect location for Lincoln Center, the theater district and Central Park. From the smiling and talkative doorman to the speedy check in and check out receptionist to the friendly and capable housekeeper, the staff were all way above average.
Oct 14 2009 	Awesome!	Great Hotel, very nice employees, with a modern 50's - 60's design and next to Central Park.For a first time in NY it's the best place to stay, Uptown.
Oct 12 2009 	Perfect New York hotel	We booked this hotel on quikbook.com at an unbelievable rate of $270/night, 2 or 3 nights before our arrival. Everything else we looked at was over $300. And this turned out to be the best place we've ever stayed in in New York. Our room was called a Pod Room, which means there is a bedroom and bathroom. No seating area and no desk! But we're never in the room anyway, so it was perfect. As you can see by the many photos here, the rooms are clean, stylish, modern. We loved that there is a Starbucks right next door, and the Columbus Circle subway station, a major subway stop with many intersecting lines, is right across the street! It's across the street from the Time Warner Center for high-end shopping. All this, plus the low rate, adds up to a perfect New York hotel.
Oct 8 2009 	Great hotel- needed desk in room and the breakfast options can be improved.	Great Location, beautiful room, however it needed a desk to work on.The breakfast is served in the Japanese restaurant and was not at the standard that I expected.
Oct 6 2009 	Beware of their booking system!	I recently stayed in New York and had originally booked this hotel going by some of the reviews on here, but still a bit sceptical about the room size. This was a personal trip, but I was hoping to use the hotel and add it to my list for accommodating my business clients and staff. Anyway, about a week before my stay I found a much better deal so decided to cancel the booking. I rang the hotel from the airport on way to another trip and everything was sorted (or I so I thought..).I got back after my stay to find an email thanking me for my stay, and asking me to fill in a questionnaire! I checked my credit card and sure enough I've been charged $290 for the first night. So I email the hotel was told blankly that I would not be refunded because I didn't keep the cancellation number (who the hell keeps these anyway). I expected the hotel to send me an email confirming my cancellation but nothing arrived. Like I said I was at the airport and wouldn't be able to check until I returned.So if you have to stay there be careful when making your booking. Who knows what the dodgy booking system might do!Whilst in NY I called into the hotel after reading about the sushi restaurant, obviously before I found that I'd been ripped off. It was very overpriced and there is a much nicer sushi bar a few doors away. The hotel is not actually on Columbus Circle at all, but a side street, and the view is of the back of a high-rise shopping centre. And it's more than a walk to Time Square. There's much better to be had in NY and in the other hotel I had a room on the 37th floor with a view of the Empire State Building for less money.
Sep 21 2009 	Great location contemporary interior design	Me and my boyfriend have stayed in a standard queen room for two nights. Rooms were well decorated in a contemporary minimalist style with great artwork on the walls. The size of the room is not big, but standard for NY. Room itself was very clean, designer toiletries in the bathroom. Pity they didn't have a trash can in the room, only in bathroom. I wish they could improve on the lighting, it was a bit dark. We found location very convenient, right next to subway and huge shopping center with Whole Foods, where we got our breakfast. There was a sushi restaurant downstairs which looked very good and very busy every night. Cabs were easy to catch right next to the hotel. Staff was very polite and helpful, as well as good looking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.
Sep 8 2009 	Good Hotel - Extremely Friendly Staff	This is a good hotel in a great location with extremely friendly and helpful staff. I wouldn't t think that would make a difference but it does. The hotel staff definitely make this place worth a try.
Sep 7 2009 	Good hotel but.....	My husband booked this hotel in Jan 09 for my 50th birthday in Aug, he booked a queen superior &amp; also put on the booking form that it was for a &quot;special birthday&quot; and could we have a room with a nice view. When we arrived we were allocated room 79-it was the SMALLEST room I have even seen, and looking out of the very small window the only view was of a very large white soil pipe running down the middle of the window, when I challenged the porter as to what grade of room it was, he said it was a &quot;pod&quot; room, we explained that we had booked a queen superior he suddenly changed his mind and said yes it was a queen superior! We did get moved to a better room after complaining to the front desk (still no nice view and certainly no up grade, as lots of other people seemed to get in the reviews) In the 4 days we were there only 1 of the 2 elevators worked &amp; we were on the 7th floor. Apart from the above the hotel is in a great location and was clean &amp; tidy. We felt the hotel was all style &amp; no substance, it all looks very classy on the web site.
Aug 16 2009 	Trendy but nice...	I was persuaded to stay here by my boss instead of the Parker Meridien as she counts it as one of her favorite hotels in NYC. I came for meetings and stayed for the weekend with my partner. I thought this was a charming hotel with well-chosen decor and amenities - from the mid-century furniture in the lobby to the fur-covered walls of the elevators. My room was cozy with teak walls, great magazines, a small free-standing wardrobe and blue-tiled bathroom complete with Kiehls bath products. The location is right across the TimeWarner Center (and Columbus Circle subway stop). Time Square is a few blocks away, as well as some great restaurants. I would definitely stay here again.
Jul 23 2009 	Still Doing Well	I first stayed at 6 Columbus in November of 2007 not too long after it opened and enjoyed it very much. Since then I have had occasion to return to it a few times but haven't entered a review, so thought I would provide current thoughts. My most recent stay was from July 1-4 this year. Virtually all of my bookings there have been through Quikbook for under $200 a night in a Pod or Queen room. I don't spend much time in my Manhattan hotel rooms outside of sleeping, so I'm pretty easy to please on things like having enough space to swing a cat and tend to focus more on things like a comfortable bed, overall cleanliness, a quiet place to put your head down and a clean and functional bathroom. 6 Columbus has never disappointed on any of these fronts on any stay. It has, quite simply, become my hotel of choice in Manhattan.I can't say enough about the location - Time Warner shops, restaurants and bars and one Bkn-Brx subway stop literally right across the street, a Bkn-Qns subway stop around the corner, and Central Park as close as you can get for the money. I'm not such a lover of cities that I can do without green space so while I might go shopping in Soho, I ain't staying there. The hotel's own bar is a nice place to gather troops before starting out or for a nightcap.Staff continues to be helpful, and I've had only one negative check-in experience in the nature of no room being available when I arrived and the 15 promised minutes becoming 45, but this is definitely the exception.There's nothing yet that has been serious enough to send me elsewhere.
Jun 24 2009 	Fundamentally unacceptable	6 Columbus was disappointing during my recent two-week stay. I travel as a consultant to non-profits, and my clients understandably want to keep hotel expenses reasonable, which 6 Columbus's rates do accomplish. I am content with a hotel that falls far short of luxury, but 6 Columbus did not meet basic needs. The rooms are small, including &quot;suites,&quot; which, surprisingly, are not really suites but rather single rooms like all others. My room reminded me of a college dorm room. It had no closet but did have a small armoire, regrettably not deep enough to hold a clothes hanger back to front, and wide enough to hold very few shirts or suits. Inquiring at the front desk, I was alerted that two cupboards were built into one side of the base of the bed, which I had not seen since a duvet hung over them. This helped, but it meant I had to get on my knees to retrieve anything. I was a single traveler; I cannot imagine how more than one person could negotiate this room. Of course the hotel finds plenty of space for its in-room mini-bar, food, and souvenir concessions. That duvet, by the way, was not clean (showing organic remnants of a previous guest), and was finally laundered or replaced on the fourth day, despite my earlier requests. The duvet is the only bed-covering: there's no sheet, so you sleep under the duvet (which, for me, became unbearably hot) or nothing. I soon realized this was not such a bad thing. Because the noise level is high (especially from staff in the hallways--and I was not even near the elevator), the only effective strategy is to turn the AC way down so it runs as much as possible to drown out the noise at night, and then it's so cold in the room that the duvet is perfect. A large roach or water-bug ground into the carpet remained for several days after my arrival (and impossible to miss) until I forced the cleaning person to deal with it as I stood by and watched. The cleaning staff was invariably pleasant; one day, however, I returned to the room at 5 in the afternoon to find them just starting on my room, which was inconvenient. The room telephone received calls, but I could not dial out or retrieve messages that were left (though they announced their presence through the blinking light). A manager came to the room to try to fix it and confessed that the hotel's whole phone system was &quot;a total mess.&quot; In two weeks the phone was never fixed. One night I called the front desk, via my cell phone, to arrange an early wake-up call the next morning and the call arrived as requested. The next morning after that someone from the staff banged on my door at the same early hour, shouting that this was my wake-up call but my phone wasn't working. (Unfortunately, that was to have been my sleep-in day.) Room was quite dark, even with all the lights on full, as the window gave on to a deep air-shaft that let in little light. Bathroom was to the usual small-hotel standard. Hallways are very narrow and are made more difficult to navigate by room-service trays, which spend entire days without being collected. Sometimes these sit in stairwells, which must surely be a safety violation. The in-room information book says they deliver the NY Times every morning, but instead they delivered the NY Post, an entirely different species of newspaper. I pointed this out at the front desk, and although the staff-person seemed not to grasp what I was saying, they did deliver the Times (along with the Post) the next day and most days thereafter. Front-desk staff was generally cold and unhelpful. Concierge was pleasant and doormen were eager and cheerful. Entry hallway leading from lobby to elevators is kept very dark (sexy and mysterious, I guess) but I found it impossible to see when entering from the brightness of the street (often via a small homeless encampment outside) and guests were forever colliding with each other in that dark hallway. 6 Columbus cultivates a chic and high-attitude veneer but does not address the essentials of what a hotel must minimally provide. Internet is $10 per day; I might expect a hotel that tries to trade in trendiness would offer it for free, as so many now do. They do respond somewhat to nudging. Still, for a two-week stay it grew depressing, and I cannot recommend this hotel.
Jun 21 2009 	Fabulous Upgrade and Great stay in a good NY location	Arrived Tuesday 16th for a 3 night stay, I had booked what i thought was a good deal via Quickbook for a studio suite worked out at $203+taxes, i was to very pleasantly suprised to be upgraded to a huge duplex loft suite that had great view over Time Warner.Room had two flat screen TV's, great shower and bathroom facilities,very comfy bed and pillows and a great fridge and freezer with Microwave and hob if you need it.So great start to a good break.The Location for uptown is superb, MTA just cross over the road, only a few minutes to walk to Central park and 5-10 minutes across to 5th Avenue and it's many and numerous shops.Whole foods in the basement of Time Warner building just across the road is good to buy grocery for breakfast.Hotel staff were very friendly, and kept good humour in some very unseasonal wet weather in New York, good recommendation for lunch from staffReally enjoyed my stay at 6 Columbus and would be very happy to return
Jun 20 2009 	Hmmm does boutique have to have attitude?	We booked via quikbook for a 3 night stay in June. The quikbook add said free upgrade. So upon arrival (at around 1630 check in from 1500), we were told (tersely to say the least) that 1. no room was ready, there would be a 15 minute wait and 2. there were no upgrades as they hotel was full.We waited (no apology or drink/anything offered) patiently, for about 20 minutes and finally feeling pretty ignored we questioned whether our room was ready. &quot;Don't know&quot; came the reply &quot;the hotel is full you know!&quot;. Since when has a hotel been full been the guests fault!!!! Huffily we are given an upgrade (amazing since the hotel was full!!!! presumably someone who was late got downgraded then?).Only complaint about the room was that the view was of a grotty back of an apartment block (but then we weren't expecting a panaroma!). Beds were very comfy.On the plus the location is great. The reception and attitude we got on arrival really soured things for us. I wouldn't stay again unless it was an exceptionally good deal.
Jun 11 2009 	great location	I got a great deal on Priceline for $130.00 a night. It was very clean and nicely designed. Rooms are small, but who spends time in their room in NYC? Heated bathroom floors were a great plus, as were the Kiehl's products. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The best thing that this hotel is its location. It is located literally right next to a subway stop - 1, A, B, C, D. The hotel restaurant, Blue Ribbon, has very good sushi.
Jun 9 2009 	Bait and Switch ...	First off, let me tell you that my husband and I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars in the Hollywood Roosevelt over the past several years. We lived in Hollywood during most of that time, and we encouraged many, many of our friends to stay there while visiting us in LA. We also spent several NYE's and multiple Memorial/Labor Days with you. Since we moved from LA, we chose you to stay when business brought us back to LA. We LOVE the Roosevelt Hotel!!!! We have always been treated with the utmost respect and, in fact, were recently upgraded when we checked in for a 1-night stay in 11/08.Based on this love, we booked the Six Columbus via a travel agent to celebrate my husband's 39th birthday this past weekend, for a studio suite at the rate of $220/nt. Although there were cheaper rooms available at your hotel, we decided to spend a bit more since it was my husband's birthday. We were so sorely disappointed that I must bring it to your attention in the hope that it will be addressed. We arrived in NYC at approx 4 pm on Wed June 3rd, 2009, and travelled to the Six Columbus, which took approx 1.5 hrs by the time we got our luggage. Our plan was to check in, freshen up and then meet up with friends for a dinner reservation at the Gramercy Park (Rose Room) for dinner at 7:30 pm. When we arrived we were informed that the front staff already knew about Dean's birthday, and that we were being checked into room 111, &quot;a very nice room.&quot; When the bellman took us up to the room, we were disappointed to discover that the room was not in any way a &quot;suite&quot;, but a regular (albeit nice) hotel room. We contacted the front desk, and the person assured us that the room was in fact a &quot;studio suite&quot; even though there was no suite area whatsoever, and the room did not match the room photos displayed on the website we had booked through (www. newyorkluxuryhotels.com). Even the bellman who brought our bags confirmed that the room was not considered a &quot;studio suite&quot; but a king superior room. We felt hustled - our first and stereotypical experience of NYC.We contacted the travel agent with whom we had booked, and that agent began the process of straightening things out, and ultimately relocating us to another hotel. All the while, time marched on as we attempted to solve our problem ON MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY in the hope of making a timely dinner reservation in NYC. In the interim, the (lovely) bellman came up and informed us that the manager, Costas, had &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a king suite. The bellman took us down to room 20, which was the EXACT picture on the website depicted on that site of the studio suite that we had booked (as well as the king suite on that site). Unfortunately, the room was on the second floor directly overlooking the street, and EXTREMELY NOISY. Because we knew that we were being jerked around, and that this room was not an &quot;upgrade&quot; but the original room that we were promised, we protested. By now we had lost any chance we had of making our reservation at the Gramercy Park for dinner, and we were still dealing with our room situation. My husband went down to discuss the situation with the manager, &quot;Costas&quot;, and came up fuming with the comment that he should have known he was going to be hustled by a Greek (my husband is himself Greek - in fact we were married in Santorini, Greece). Extremely disappointing start to our NYC trip, and we did in fact miss our dinner reservation at Gramercy, which could not be rescheduled due to how busy they were that night. Basically, my husband;'s birthday celebration with friends was ruined thanks to &quot;Costas&quot; at the Six Columbus.The next day, thankfully, we moved to the Smyth Tribeca. Now THIS IS A HOTEL that knows about service!! We were treated with courtesy and respect, and the hotel was great! Too bad that one of our four nights in NYC was ruined.
May 29 2009 	Great hotel great location	We booked a queen superior room for 6 nights and were upgraded to a queen deluxe at check in. The room was a good size for New York and to a good standard. Staff were excellant and very friendly, we really couldn't fault anything about the hotel during our stay. The hotel is right at the edge of Central Park and in a very good location for visiting the rest of Manhatten. Prices seemed to change quite a bit before we booked and we got an excellant rate on the hotel website. The hotel is very close to Whole Foods in the Time Warner building which was brilliant for a wide range of good food. Would definitely stay there again.
May 17 2009 	Great hotel excellent location extremelly friendlly staff	We stayed in this hotel 5 nights as part of our honeymoon and we had one of our best times in NYC. Usually NYC hotels offer either small and old rooms, or big and old rooms. This case was totally new and refreshing. The 6 Columbus is a small boutique hotel in the middle of Manhattan offering modern and comfortable rooms, combined with friendlly and professional staff. The first thing we liked about the hotel is that, as honeymooners, they upgraded our room to a Studio Suite. We got a room on the 10th floor. It was a spacious room, with a big bathroom full of &quot;goodies&quot;. I must say that the bed is one of the best I've ever slept on. The area is excellent. The nearest subway is across the street, the park is two minutes away and you have lots of shops and places to eat in the vecinity. For all the sushi lovers I recommend the Blue Ribbon restaurant on the hotel, excellent sushi, friendlly and non-pretentious.Resuming, if you are looking for a nice boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan, this is definately your place. The prices are attractive and the return is more than enough. We are definatelly looking forward to visiting this hotel again.The only negative thing I can think about is that the internet was not free...
May 10 2009 	Great Location would stay again	We recently stayed at 6 Columbus for two nights as part of a three week NYC stay where we changed hotels a few times to experience different neighbourhoods. Our first impression was that the front desk were not too friendly, however the doormen were extremely friendly. On check in we were given a room on the 2nd floor, (243 i think?) and it was pretty much what you see on the internet pictures. Nice retro style, but small room, if that was a queen bed then i'm the queen of england! it was barely a double i think. Bathroom was nice with good keihls ammenities....however we didn't stay in this room long, we had a shower straight away as we'd just come in from DC on the train, and immediately realised the noise of the air con unit outside was absolutely insane! It was a constant hum and every five mins it would 'kick into gear' and go up to a dull roar! We both said, 'we can't stay in this room' so went down and asked to be swapped, they had a room on the 8th floor available which was nowhere near as noisy so we took that one, even though it had a slightly strange smell about it-i think perhaps a weird air freshener? Room 845 (i think) was a bit bigger as well, and also had a window you could look out not a frosted glass window where i felt a bit claustrophobic like in the 2nd floor room!Staff were helpful, we asked one of the doormen for a dinner reccommendation and it was good, didn't eat at the hotel restaurant so can't comment on that.Loved the location right opposite the Time Warner building with Whole Foods in the basement which we patronised for breakfast, lunch and snacks, the subway is also right there too which is handy. We walked to 9th ave where there are many great restaurants and it was only about 7mins walk which was great. Would definitely stay here again and make sure i get a high floor room, we had a Queen deluxe i think and we got what i thought was a great rate on quikbook. Note: take the elevator up to the roof deck and take some photos from up there, we got some great shots, if they ever get the bar open up there it will be an excellent spot.
Apr 29 2009 	Loved it! Spacious studio suite friendly staff great location...	We were staying for four nights and booked on QuikBooks - it worked out at 4 nights for the price of 3, average of $224 per night. We stayed in a studio suite on the 11th floor. Friends of ours stayed on the 10th floor in a studio suite.The suite was very spacious with lots . Bathroom had a great walk-in shower with great water pressure, and also a bath which I personally love. An oddity about the bathroom is clear glass in the window. Room had a wooden floor which I liked and the bed was large and comfortable, and there was lots of storage space. On the downside, air conditioning was noisy at times, and sound travelled from other rooms. The suite on the 10th floor was more compact, didn't have the walk-in shower, but had a fantastic balcony space (although a chair or two would have been nice). Given the hot weather, this was a great place to relax, especially in the evening.The bar and restaurant wasn't to my taste as I'm not into Japanese food - but it was busy most nights and the food looked like a work of art. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful to us at all times although they seemed a little clueless with how to deal with a guest that had her handbag stolen from the Starbucks next door - there was no advice on hand and the distraught guest had to try to think of all the things that had to be done herself from ringing the consultate to cancelling the credit cards to informing the police.Internet at $10 per day is expensive especially since it was wireless and there is no free access in the lobby.Overall, we loved it and we'd certainly stay there again.
Apr 25 2009 	Perfect Location Small Rooms Great Price	I was vising a friend on the UES, &amp; didn't want to pay outrageous room rates. The location is perfect, as it's behind the Time Warner Bldg, on the lower left hand corner of Central Park.Good: There's a subway station across the street, &amp; plenty of taxis. I opted for the &quot;Pod Room&quot; as I was only there for 1 night, and didn't care much about view. The room was smaller then rooms I've had in Paris...though it was very nice. The shower was impressive, as most hotels don't have that much water pressure.Bad: The &quot;Pod Room&quot; is that it's view is of a inaccessible courtyard...which has a large HVAC pipe running up the center of it. During the night you hear Banshee like howls as this kicks on/off. If your intolerant of &quot;white noise&quot; you won't like the loud blowing of the AC into your room.(I quite liked it). The iPod alarm clock has a backlit LCD which is very bright. (other then unplugging it, I couldn't figure out how to turn it off).
Apr 22 2009 	A disappointment!	We selected this hotel because of a prior stay at the beautiful and luxurious 60 Thompson, another hotel in this hotel group. 6 Columbus was a big disappointment because the room king size room was small and dark, the carpet was worn, and the furniture was run down. The veneer of the dresser was peeling and the furniture looked as if it had been purchased at an inexpensive second hand shop. The plus was a nice bathroom and the shower had good water pressure. A big negative was the food smells that pervaded the hallway and the room--something that I was unpleasantly aware of throughout the stay. The bell staff is helpful and friendly, but the day manager was markedly unimpressed with my dissatisfaction about the quality of the room and the food smells. We would not stay there again, despite the good location.
Apr 19 2009 	my new favorite hotel in NYC	Yes, the rooms are small. but really is that much different than most other rooms in nyc? The pros of this hotel are great - (location to CP, subway, CNN mall, wholefoods, starbucks, great price from website) - but what really makes this place great is the staff. Every staff I've encountered (this was now my second time here) goes out of there way to be friendly, helpful and to remember you by name and preferences. I'll be back again on my next biz trip to NYC!!
Apr 18 2009	Nice hotel some issues	Booked a queen room through Quikbooks. I was grateful to check in early since I had just flown in on the red eye. Staff were cordial and helpful. Room was a good size and stylish. Bed was comfy. Found a couple of short hairs pinned to the undersheet of the comforter. I'm pretty sure the sheets were clean for the most part, since the staff inspected the room before they allowed me to check in. Rarely heard any noise from other guests, except when they shut their doors. To lock the door there's really no way to shut it softly. Housekeeping sometimes chatted loudly in the hallway, and they start knocking loudly on doors around 8.30 am to clean the rooms. Bathroom was large. Bathtub drained slowly. Had to turn off the water to let the water drain, before turning it back on. The tub finally clogged up on the last day of my stay. At check-out, hotel tried to charge me $2.75 for the mini-bar, even though I didn't use it. I thought it was a fridge for my personal use. I explained this and they promptly removed the charge. Despite the negatives, I did enjoy my stay. I feel I got a good deal on the room (I've stayed at the Hotel East Houston, which was advertised at a similar price, but not nearly as nice). The hotel is conveniently across the street from metro station and shopping. Nearby coffee shops were okay. Preferred Whole Foods across the street for better prices and better tasting food than places nearby. Bouchon Bakery, in the same complex as Whole Foods, makes very good macarroons.
Apr 12 2009 	Does trendy have to mean dim?	The things that I liked about 6 Columbus include the great location and the great online deal that I got from the hotel's website. I especially loved the discovery of Wholefoods right across the road in Columbus Circle shops - best place for breakfast and snacks.I love the atmosphere of the hotel - very hip and trendy, but I really don't understand why this seems to mean that everything has be kept in semi darkness. Putting on make up in a dimly lit bathroom is a nightmare, and the bedroom itself is little better.Things that I didn't like (other than groping in the dark) are that the room is seriously small with no room for big bags for travellers in the middle of a big trip, and the in room internet is very expensive.There was also an inidentified loud hum that went on all night - possibly a heater or aircon unit outside - either way it had us shopping for earplugs.
Apr 9 2009 	Excellent service with a smile	This hotel was great for a number of reasons. One of the first things we noticed was the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was so helpful. Because we arrived early in the morning our room was not ready, however, they called us on our cell phone as soon as it was available. They were very helpful with restaurant suggestions. Great staff! Perfect location-right by Central Park; subway across the street; Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner; 24 hour pharmacy at the corner; great breakfast spot just up the street. Shower was great and room was small, but clean. We didn't spend a lot of time there anyway so it didn't matter. Only complaint was that they didn't offer shower caps in the bathroom. Price was very reasonable compared to other N.Y. hotels.
Mar 24 2009 	Very central next to Central Park	We stay 5 nights in the Pod room with a double bed and we found it very roomy with a nice large bathroom. This room is much larger than the regular one at Hudson hotel where 2 persons can barely walk around the bed or fit in the bathroom. I like the room design very much. The double bed is very adequate for 2 medium build persons. Kiehlï¿½s amenities are a plus and the heated bathroom floor is a nice touch. The bed is almost as comfortable as the heavenly bed from the Westin hotels with build-in drawer in the bed frame for additional storage space. The location of this hotel is perfect for us as we came here for the opera at the MET at the Lincoln Center (less than 5 minutes walk) and the Central Park is just across. In front of the hotel is the Time Warner Center which blocks all the traffic noise. The Columbus circle subway is in the Time Warner Center where all the major line connected. We have breakfast at the organic Whole Foods Market in the Time Warner Center where they sell food by weight, so you only pay what you want to eat. You can have excellent meal here (hot/cold) when you are in rush before the opera. The Starbuck is next door to the hotel for caffeine addicted. The staff is super nice. It is a super deal at 120$ in New York City!!! On the down side, the curtain cannot be close tightly, the room door needs a stopper to avoid the banging when it is close, especially at night and the walls are a little thin. But this should not stop you from reserve at this hotel. If you hate morning light, binder clips should solve your problem.
Mar 23 2009 	Thin walls = no sleep	Small rooms were dimly lit. Super thin walls I could hear every noise/shower/music/conversation that were taking place in the adjacent rooms. There was a party taking place on my floor that wasn't moved till early in the morning so basically I didn't get any sleep and it totally ruined the next day for me. The only pluses were that the rooms were clean, staff is nice, I got a cheap rate using quikbook, and the location.
Mar 17 2009 	Small rooms doesn't begin to describe it	An otherwise acceptable stay (5 nights) degraded by a room (allegedly the largest and clearly the highest price offered short of a suite) in which we couldn't sit down, except on the bed, even to work at the desk. One chair was offered, in a dimly lit vestibule. Otherwise there was literally no room to move. Closet space was a free-standing wardrobe with barely a foot of hanging space. Storage space was a drawer under the bed. Plumbing noises from adjacent rooms were noticeable and from time to time (especially during neighbors' showers) loud. I accept that space is at a premium in New York, but this is absurd. On the plus side, such as it was, it's convenient to Lincoln Center, pleasant and helpful staff and a good restaurant (Blue Ribbon) with excellent sushi. If you plan to spend any time in your room, look elsewhere.
Mar 1 2009 	Exceptional Service and Value	My wife and I stayed at 6 Columbus during a random weekend in New York this February. We found 6 Columbus through Tripadvisor and were encouraged by its ranking (#128 as of this writing). In short, we were not disappointed with our choice, as it turned out to be anf extraordinary value for a NYC hotel!First off, a caveat about the location for this hotel for people not familiar with NYC. It's located right off Columbus Circle, a good 20 minute walk from Times Square. This wasn't a deal breaker by any means, however, and the Columbus Circle Subway stop is right near the hotel anyway. A Taxi ride right into the heart of Times Square was a measly $3.50, as well.Upon arrival, the doors were opened for us and we were greeted with a smile and a polite welcome by everyone in the modern-decor lobby - a great way to start a stay. Check in was a non-issue and we quickly found ourselves in one of the animal hide (fake)-lined elevators going to our room on the 9th Floor (there are 12 floors of rooms with two floors above that).We opened the door to our Queen Deluxe room and found a warmly lit, intimately sized room with a modern twist. Dark Teak floors are throughout the the main room, and you have amenities such as a Flat-screen LCD TV, mini-fridge, safe, bathrobe, iron/ironing board, iPod Alarm Clock and one of the most comfortable hotel beds we've ever slept on! The brown teak headboard for the bed spanned the entire length of the wall behind us, but stopped short from the ceiling by about 6-8 inches. This space hid a recessed light that lent a nice, indirect glow to the room when on.The bathroom seems light standard fare, but is very clean and boasts an interesting extra feature - heated floors! What a treat to not step onto a cold tile floor after a nice, hot shower.After settling into our room, we made our way downstairs where we found Eric the Concierge. He was perhaps one of the most helpful and knowledgeable concierges we've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He helped us with everything from our dinner plans to making reservations for us at a comedy club he recommended. Definitely a great resource to have when in NYC - even if you consider yourself knowledgeable.We had lunch at the Hotel's Blue Ribbon restaurant (Japanese) and found it about average and maybe a tad overpriced - quite contrary to the hotel. Mind you, there was nothing wrong with the Sushi we ordered, but it wasn't anything to write home about and the service was impersonal but prompt. I would say it's convenient, but you have better choices literally right across the street in the Time-Warner Building. One other note about the hotel - bring your own computer, as they do not have a business center. Overall, 6 Columbus was an excellent value, and I would highly recommend it as a great hotel outside of Times Square.
Feb 11 2009 	Fantastic Find In The City	Where can you stay in New York where the staff knows you by name after the first day? Wonderful location near theatre, shopping and park. Rooms very nice and staff the best in New York. Great Value. Can't wait to visit again.
Feb 8 2009 	Great great location -- tiny tiny room	We stayed at the hotel for two nights. Terrific location. It's just across the street from the subway &amp; there's a great international newstand around the corner. For those who indulge in Starbucks, there's one right next to the hotel. Our room was really small. The queen-size bed felt more like a twin. The room was clean but not smartly designed. There's a great big flat screen TV -- but no hooks for your coat. The bathroom floor was heated -- but there's virtually no closet space. Great shelves for magazines -- but very little drawer space. Talk about priorities all mixed up!Overall, our stay was pleasant &amp; the staff was pleasant. The price was right too.
Feb 4 2009 	Great Rate made a Great Hotel	We stayed at the 6 Columbus for 5 nights at the end of Jan 2009. We got a superb rate through Quikbook, which made this hotel very affordable. I booked a Queen superior, as i had been informed that the pod rooms were very small. If i was indeed given a queen room, then those pod rooms must be a broom cupboard. Having said that the room was more than adequate for the 2 of us, as we did not intend to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. The only downside to the size of the room, was lack of storage for clothes, and given that it was winter we had a lot of bulky clothes, but we managed.The room was on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel, with a nice view of the shaft, but didn't think this mattered as I wasn't going to spend my time looking out of the window.The under floor heating in the bathroom was indeed a nice touch, as other's have mentioned, but couldn't quite work out how it worked. The shower was great - powerful &amp; hot! The only downside of the bathroom was the miniscule towels - no good for wrapping up wet hair! The mini bar was packed full, but didn't try anything as there is a Duane Reade next door. Service at the hotel was very good, very attentative door staff, and it was nice to receive a plate of cookies half way through our stay. The bar staff where also very pleasant in the Blue Ribbon bar &amp; restaurant (we did not eat there). The cleaning staff where a little noisy in the mornings, but really we should have been up and seeing the sights anyway.This hotel is in a great location, right opposite the subway, and over the way from Central Park, a few nice bars &amp; restaurants nearby. I would definitely recommend this hotel, but only if you can get a great rate, as otherwise i think it is quite pricey.
Feb 3 2009 	Mixed	I have to differ with most of the reviews I've read. Maybe it's a generation thing. Yes, the staff are fine: very helpful. And the place is clean. But: why is it that so many &quot;4 star&quot; hotels in NYC give you less than a Holiday Inn and charge you much more money? No coffee in the room. No free WiFi. No ironing board/iron. Three big marks against the place in my book. And the NYC-tiny rooms. Not as bad as the Hudson down the street, but still: no place to sit and relax, read a book, etc. And the decor. Yikes! Dark blue hallways; elevator walls covered in faux black fur with industrial metal accents. I felt like I was entering a dungeon. But it's a fabulous location. The bed was OK, the soaps were nice, and it was quiet. But then again, I booked with Priceline, so my window faced an brick wall, not the street.
Feb 2 2009	Rip off rate for international phone calls! Don't stay here!	We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks and we are from Hong Kong. So making a few international phone calls back home was necessary. After staying at the hotel for a few days and making just a few phone calls (literally less than 5 or 6 calls got thru the line and none of our calls were more than 10 minutes each), I asked the concierge how much our phone bill was. Guess what? 6 Columbus charged me more than US$500+ for just a few phone calls!!! They explained that international phone calls cost US$10 per minute. This rate was absolutely ridiculous and the manager blamed us by saying that why didn't we check out the rate in the little book stored in our desk b4 we make the calls. After speaking the manager, we checked out the booklet and it actually didn't set out the rate at all but just mentioned that guests should ask the concierge for the exact rate for making international phone calls. It just didn't make sense to us at all. How could you justify charging the guest US$10 per minute? My 5 minute phone call to a friend asking a few questions cost me US$50+!!!! Completely ridiculous. WE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY INTERNATIONAL GUEST TO STAY AT 6 COLUMBUS. It's a complete rip off, given that the economy is so poor in the US. Such ridiculous charging rate is totally unacceptable. And the worse thing was, they refuse to do anything about it at all!!!!!!!!! Our original impression of the hotel was actually pretty good, given the location and the hotel rate and all that. But with the rip off phone rates, i guess that's how the hotels make profit!!! We are going to tell all our friends NOT to stay here if anyone goes to NYC. Completely disappointed!!!!!!
Jan 23 2009 	Beauty Brains and Brawn. Must Read review!	My Monday (MLK Holiday) overnight accommodations at 6 Columbus far exceeded my expectations. I was greeted by the Doorman as I entered and again by the host of Blue Ribbon Sushi &amp; Grill. The staff at the front desk were delightful, especially Adrianna! My reservation for a Pod room was gleefully upgraded to a suite, room 103 on the tenth floor. The lobby is small but neatly furnished with a long modern sofa and bright round club chairs. Neat artistï¿½s prints hung on the wall, low lighting down the hallway of the elevators. The elevators are modern. I stepped into a blue hallway with Thompson Hotels signature carpet. I felt like I was in a residential apartment building with my room number glowing bright. My room key was tucked into a designer 6 Columbus packet.I entered into an oversized, modern, thoughtfully designed room. Large platform bed, Frette Linens and robe, 2 modern side chairs and table and flat screen television and black and white cabinet with mini bar, Dean &amp; Deluca snack tray and available shag kit.Luxurious drapes hide French doors which lead to a giant balcony; behind frosted doors were a large walk in closet and gorgeous bathroom. Another window looking towards 58th street was tucked in an angled corner, beautifully shaded silver floor lamp.No carpet! All hardwood floors and allergy-free including the teak headboard. Wall pockets containing glossy design and fashion magazines. 2 bendable reading lamps.A blue throw, white duvet, striped pillow and drapes were all made of the finest quality luxury material. The bathroom was a standout with navy vertical subway tiles, under mounted sink, private loo area, free standing two person shower, large deep soaking tub with its own shower. High end bath toiletries from Kiehlï¿½s, thoughtful extras like cotton balls and swabs, fluffy white towels and a giant round magnifying mirror under lit in blue. Located in the lobby is Blue Ribbon Sushi &amp; Grill, always open extra late and welcoming to my late arrival. Located directly across the street from 6 Columbus is the Time Warner Center, a luxury shopping venue. Close to subways, Columbus Circle and Central Park made 6 Columbus a Thompson Hotel to be envied by all Manhattan boutique Hotels.Yes, I will stay there again. Thank you 6 Columbus.
Jan 21 2009 	Amazing Stay (And yes the doormen are hot!)	I booked the hotel through Quickbook at a rate of $127 for Fri/Sat and $90 for Sun. There were no problems with the booking, and I would throughly recommend Quikbook as a third party agent.Upon checkin I was given a free upgrade from standard queen to supeior (or deluxe - not sure which it is). The doormen make you feel very special, and could not do more to help. (As others have said they are all pretty hot too!!) :) I didn't really find the noise of the aircon too loud, the view was of some non-descript building and some shafts, but that didn't bother me. The only minor negatives I can think of (and I'm having to think hard) were that the ipod docking station wasn't dusted down and the bed frame sticks out a little, so I banged my leg a few times! For the rate I got, these are such small things that it really means nothing compared to the fantastic service, and great clean rooms at the 6 Columbus. Location, quality and genuine warmth and hospitality from the staff here makes this place exactly what it is: a PERFECT little hotel for any traveller to New York City.
Jan 14 2009	Terrific stay at 6 Columbus	My friend and I got an amazing rate at 6 Columbus through Quikbook for January 9-12 ($127 for Fri-Sat, $90 for Sunday). We had an excellent stay from the moment we walked through the doors and the very friendly doorman took our bags and welcomed us. All the staff were kind and helpful, providing excellent service.Without asking, our room was upgraded free of charge to a queen deluxe with two beds, which was perfect. The room was spotless, and housekeeping brought us a second robe and non-feather pillows for my friend, who is allergic. The bed platforms are a bit of a nuisance, but not a big deal. Our biggest complaint was probably that the ice bucket, while very stylish, was quite shallow and not really functional. Clearly I'm really nitpicking here!I've seen comments complaining about the loud heating/air system, and it is indeed loud. However, if you're like me and my friend and you need white noise to sleep, it's perfect. The beds are also very, very comfortable and we both slept like babies.The hotel location is perfect. Right by the subway, a Subway sandwich shop, Starbucks, and a Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center across the street. Easy walk to Central Park and the theatre district, and when we were in a rush to make a show, the cab down cost $4 and took five minutes. While I wouldn't want to spend $500+ a night at 6 Columbus (or anywhere, for that matter), I definitely recommend the hotel. We had a great stay, and even received a hug from the doorman when we left. It was a terrific weekend.
Jan 6 2009 	Exceptional Staff - Wonderful PLace	Let's start with the only &quot;negative&quot;. My room was small. But everything needed was provided in a well-designed and aesthetically pleasing space. The bed, linens and towels added to a feeling of luxury and style.The staff was the real standout in an otherwise great experience. Every single individual working at the hotel took the time to greet me. Anyone that I addressed with a request, question or simply a &quot;hello&quot; responded warmly and wholeheartedly. Their friendliness (which was never anything but respectful) created the sense of having a home base in NYC and really added to the pleasure of my trip.
Jan 5 2009 	Very friendly and stylish hotel in great location!	The best thing by far about 6 Columbus is the location. You are within walking distance to both the theater district and Lincoln Center, and you are close to many fine restaurants. The Columbus Circle subway stop is literally right across the street.The hotel itself is very modern, and although the lighting and decor were not quite to my taste, I must say that the staff was the friendliest I've encountered at a hotel in a long time. The room, while small, was spotless. Our only complaint would be that the heater seemed to just blow cold air around the room, so we ended up just turning it off and asking for another duvet. Actually, even with the heat off the room wasn't really all that cold.The heated bathroom floor was a really neat feature.We got a great rate through the hotel website, and we'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who's planning on attending a show or concert and doesn't need a whole lot of space.
Jan 4 2009 	Great Hotel	We stayed in the 6 Columbus Hotel for 5 nights in March 2008 for St Patrick's weekend. Overall it's a great hotel which I would recommend. The hotel is located opposite the Time Warner building just at the bottom of Central Park, we walked nearly everywhere, it was in such a convenienct location. The staff were very friendly and helpful, check in was fine, our room wasn't ready, but we were offered complimentary drinks in the hotel bar while we waited.We had booked a 'Pod' room, however on checking in we were advised we had been upgraded to the next biggest room. Accommodation was lovely, very modern, with plasma TV, ipod docking station and minibar. We got a complimentary paper everyday and the room was cleaned daily also. We didn't eat at all in the hotel, but the restaurant always looked busy and the hotel has a nice little bar for those apres shopping drinks!!All in all I would recommend this hotel. The rooms are quite small, but hey, this is New York city, you're there to shop and to party, not sit in your room all day. Special mention to all the gang next door in The Coliseum pub, hi guys!!
Jan 4 2009 	Practically Perfect	Spent one night with family. We had two rooms. Both were upgraded, which gave us extra space (and room to hang out together), and fantastic value. Loved the style of the decor. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the sheets were TERRIFIC, and rooms were quiet (surprising to the two of us were are ex-Manhattanites!), etc. Our only complaint, if we were to have one, was that the sofabed in one of the rooms wasn't made up, which we didn't discover until we needed it (late), which entailed a short wait, improvised bedding, and making it up ourselves. (True, the &quot;turn-down&quot; staff had been by at about 6:00, but at that point, we were using the sofa as a sofa!) If you want to be near the Upper West Side and/or Theatre District and are looking for a luxurious, stylish place to stay, you'll be happy.
Dec 5 2008 	Great New York hotel!	I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel! It is BEAUTIFUL! The staff are so friendly! We arrived at this hotel at 7 in the morning from an overseas flight, we were not expecting to check in to our room until at least noon, but we thought we would try anyways. Upon arrival...we found that the room we had booked was not available, but the receptionist offered to upgrade us to a junior suite(studio suite?) for an additional $100. I was very glad we did! This room was huge and gorgeous! We had a 600 square foot balcony, no breathtaking view, but what a surprise! The concierge was more than willing to reccommend places for dinner, and get our reservations for us for shows and dinner, as well as call towncars etc! A little tip goes a long way with these people, we even recieved a &quot;WOW!&quot; from one of the guys! After making a complete mess of our room before we went out to dinner, the housekeeping staff came in and reorganized it all! I was not expecting this, as it was 5 pm, and was actually a little bit embarassed by the state of our room! Just one of the things that added to our amazing stay at this hotel!I would definitely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat!
Nov 29 2008 	Great find in NYC	We just got back from an incredible trip to New York City and Philadelphia. We stayed 1 night at 6 Columbus in NYC and it couldn't have been better. The location is great if you don't want to be at Times Square and you don't want to go as far as the &quot;Upper West Side&quot;....this hotel is located in the middle of them. It is very close to the Trump and Mandarin Hotels. It is next door to a Starbucks &amp; across from large grocery store (Whole Foods?).Now for the hotel itself. Check in took only seconds. The hotel features a very cool decor with a great city vibe. We went for the cheap seats and got a Pod Room - which is a full size bed. The room is tiny but it is flawlessly designed to maximize space. Do be careful not to hit your leg on the bed corners ~ can be quite painful :) The bed was very comfortable and had crisp white bedding. I must admit, we are not a fan of down type pillows. There was a stocked refreshment case, but we did not use it. The flat panel t.v. was quite nice . The view from our window, well we had a lovely view of nothing, but we were not in NYC to look out our window. Now for the bathroom....I have to say I now want rip out my own bath and copy the one from 6 Columbus! The floor is heated ...don't underestimate how incredible this feature is. NYC at Thanksgiving is VERY cold and this floor feels fabulous on your frozen toes. There is a very cool tiled shower (no tub) and great bath products. They even thought to give you Q-tips and Cotton balls....a lovely touch. The bathroom sink is really beautiful too with a cool gooseneck style faucet. The towels smell great too ~ sound weird I know, but the towels aren't perfumey, they just have a nice fresh smell to them ~ very pleasant.The hotel staff was excellent and they had our luggage loaded in to a cab before we ever blinked...they make everything look easy here.I would highly recommend giving this hotel a try. If you are ever planning to visit the Macy's parade then this location would be terrific. You won't see it from your window, but you'll have total access in just steps....without the chaos of Times Square.
Nov 24 2008 	Small chic hotel with excellent customer service	Recently returned from a 2 night stay at 6 Columbus. Very nice, small chic hotel in a great location central to everything. Stayed in a King Deluxe room with a very comfortable bed, &quot;cool&quot; decor with a nice flat screen tv on the wall. The entire hotel including the rooms are dimly lit which gave it a hip, night club-like atmosphere. The customer service was outstanding from start to finish. The doormen always welcomed you with a pleasant greeting, front desk staff were very friendly and courteous and check in and check out was fast and smooth. The front desk and doormen/staff communicate with wireless devices. As soon as I got there by cab the doorman opened the taxi door and asked me my name and quickly alerted the front desk via the device that I had arrived and they were totally prepared for me by the time I reached them. They even had the doormen have a cab waiting for me at the precise time I checked out and walked out the front door. Very well organized operation. The only thing I didn't like was the shower. The tile wasn't that clean and the shower head didn't work that well - no tub in the room. There was no iron in the room either. Overall, I reccommend this hotel for young singles who are looking for a cool, safe place to stay at reasonable rates.
Nov 21 2008 	Stayed at this hotel in Sept 2008. Have visited NYC several times and have sta	Out of all the hotels we have stayed in, THIS one had the very be st location. Wonderful staff, quiet, nice bar-just great for 2 people!!! Subway, Whole Foods(great for carry out to hotel after a long day with a glass of wine)Time Warner Buidling with great shops and places to dine), CVS a couple of doors down for those items you forgot to bring, PLUS a Starbucks OR another(less expensive()coffee shop. Zabars is up the street, Central Park is across the street......just a great quiet oasis in a busycity. All hotels have a negative but this one has more +s than -s!Modern and clean, you feel as though you are in NYC. My friend and I are in our late 50s and we were very comfortable with this hotel Could not beat the price
Nov 16 2008 	Small but lovely	My wife and I had a layover in NYC and decided to spend the night. The hotels was very clean and modern. All the people at front desk where very polite, friendly and helpful. I love the room. Yes it is very small but very well done. I've seen hotel try to cram too much into similar sized room but this is perfect. I will definetly stay there again.
Nov 16 2008 	Great location otherwise disappointing	We have just returned from 3 nights booked directly via hotel website which states Roof Top terrace, unfortunately, the terrace is closed until next year and consequently we found it difficult to find a seat at the already small bar area.The reception staff, housekeeping and door staff were friendly and helpful, although one couldn't help feeling they were looking for a tip.The price of $480 for a double room became $540 after 4 different taxes, despite luxurious decor, the view from the window of the building shaft led us to conclude this was an extortionate price and did not represent value for money.
Nov 9 2008 	Small accomodations but overall nice	Awesome location for this modern, boutique hotel. Right across the street from Time Warner Center. The staff members at this hotel were fantastic - from the doormen, to the front desk - all seemed to work on the guest's behalf almost effortlessly. The room (superior queen) was fine for 2 adults but a bit small. The bathroom was modern and nice. We were on the 6th floor and our view was of the HVAC system - not surprising for NYC.The hotel was perfect for us. I would certainly stay here again and would highly recommend to my friends. I wouldn't recommend to someone expecting a large, full service (restaurants, gym, etc) hotel.
Nov 8 2008 	Dark interier over rated hotel	A boutique hotel that tries way to hard. Dark over all feel. Cow skin panels in elevators and downstairs. Room 86 was $150. more then room 26, exactly the same size. Both have a view of the alley! If it had a park view maybe, but for the money it was riducuously overpriced. The elevator and our bathroom were sprayed many times with some sort of bug spray. It was disgusting! Truly wished we had stayed somewhere else.
Nov 4 2008 	NIce Change of Pace	I usually stay at Marriott or other chain hotels, pricelined this one and wasnt sure what i was goin to get. I booked the hotel thru Priceline for $120/night. Hoping to get an upgrade. Standard room is a full size bed, 175sq ft. room. I called them up and they upgrade me for $60 more to a King Superior, usually $350/nite.The hotel has a great staff and quite accomodating. The location is not on Columbus Circle, but on 58th st. You walk out the door and Columbus Circle is less than a minute walk across the street. Overall it is a nice place, rooms little small, but you pay for location.
Oct 23 2008 	Would definitely stay here again	We have just returned from our stay at 6 Columbus and our experience was very different to that of some of the other guests. We booked a Queen room for a reduced rate via the Quikbook website. The Quikbook site clearly stated that the room was for a maximum of 2 people. Upon arrival, it was clear that booking via Quikbook meant that you were given the smallest rooms in the hotel. There was no way that 2 people could stay comfortably in this Queen room.There was only 1 single wardrobe, no natural light, hardly any floor space around the bed and nowhere to store our 2 large suitcases. I spoke to Lula on the front desk and she went out of her way to ensure that we were happy with our accommodation. She showed me 2 other rooms which were much more suitable for couples and managed to offer us a larger Queen room at an extremely reasonable upgrade price. Throughout our stay, Lula made a point of checking that everything was ok with our room. With regards to the rest of the hotel we really couldn't fault it. All of the staff were extremely friendly particularly the doormen. We didn't try the restaurant but we did drink at the bar a few times and they even served sushi to us at the bar. My only gripe would be that the bar area is quite small with limited seating. The room we actually stayed in was a great size. The double wardrobe was more than adequate and there were large drawers under the bed also. The ipod docking station was a nice touch as were the Khiels toiletries in the bathroom and the free daily newspapers. The room temperature control took some getting used to but overall it served it's purpose and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was very welcme after a hard day's sightseeing. The bed was also very comfortable.Housekeeping did a great job at keeping the room immaculate and also turned down the bed every night leaving little treats on the duvet.In addition to the great service and comfortable room, the hotel is in the most amazing location. The Time Warner Centre is literally across the road which houses a large Whole Foods market and lots of nice restaurants. Starbucks is next door and there were several places to get a great breakfast just up the street. Columbus Circle was right on the doorstep including the best entrance to Central Park. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at 6 Columbus and we would definitely stay here again on our next visit to New York.
Oct 23 2008 	Fabulous Location	We stay in NYC about 6 times a year in the off season when we can find decent rates. We have stayed in many boutique hotels including Hotel Giraffe, The Muse and The Benjamin. We booked the smaller king room at 6 Columbus and it was small but how much time do you stay in the room? It was clean and the bathroom was clean and staff was great. We ask for a quiet room and it was very quiet. The hotel was great and you can't beat the location. There is no roof top bar. I read about that either on quickbook or their own site but when we went to locate it all we found was dirty laundry. There is a huge whole foods across the street to peruse including lots of food to go. We walked Central Park twice which is right across the street and we could walk to our Broadway show. We booked directly with the hotel and the same day found a considerable lower rate on quickbook. I called the hotel and they matched the rate. We will definitely stay here again.
Oct 22 2008 	Great Little Spot	Stayed at 6 Columbus for 5 nights in late September and had a wonderful time!!! I'm not terribly picky, though, and mostly look for a place that's safe and clean and 6 Columbus definitely delivers in both respects!I got a really great deal thru quikbook for a Pod room (full bed) and since I was by myself, that was perfect. I will say, however, that if I had paid the hotel's asking price of $405/night, I would have expected more. But for $180/night, it was an outstanding value!!!Yes, the room is small. But honestly, if you're in NY for the room, then you do need to go elsewhere. The bed was incredibly comfortable, linens clean and soft, and housekeeping did a wonderful job every day. The bathroom was well-appointed, though the tub was a bit small if you actually wanted to take a bath--which I refuse to do at hotels anyway. Heated floor tiles in the bathroom definitely a plus!!! Kiehl's toiletries were a wonderful touch and there was also q-tips and cotton balls in the bathroom--simple but very nice touch!1 thing I did notice missing was a coffee pot...but there is a Starbucks next door to the hotel, so it really didn't matter that much to me. The view from room 27 was terrible, as most have described, to some kind of shaft in between buildings. But you know what? I was NEVER in my room during the day looking out the window and at night the blackout drapes were closed so why do I care what the view was? So it all depends on you! After my rave reviews, my coworker stayed at 6 Columbus the very next weekend and loved it as much as I did! Oh and the umbrella they provide for you to use during your stay came in handy as it rained 4 out of the 6 days I was in NY!!! :-)Will definitely return if the price is right!
Oct 15 2008 	Honestly Not Worth It . . .	Alright, first the positives - the location is excellent (so close to Central Park, the Upper West Side, etc.), the hotel is clean and kept up nicely, and staff members are fairly friendly . . .. . . but for $250/night - even if we are talking about Manhattan - one expects more than a mere 75 square feet or so (a so-called &quot;Pod Room&quot;), with a view of a pigeon-occupied tower of space (about six feet by six feet), a tiny bathroom (admittedly with a heated floor, a nice touch), essentially upscale dorm-style furniture, and lousy temperature control.All things considered, experience suggests that one would do a lot better three times out of four by going on Priceline.com or the like, and putting in $250/night and 3.5 stars. Again, even for Manhattan, this didn't represent good value for money.
Oct 12 2008 	Great if you like bugs and bird excrement - see the pictures	God help you if you booked via a booking channel that doesn't specify the room type, like priceline.Lobby nice, doormen always exceptional. Room 49: nightmare. It's tiny, but that's not the issue - I've stayed in the Hudson's even tinier rooms happily. It's not pleasant to have nowhere to open your suitcase except on the bed, but that's not the big problem here.The window in the room overlooks a waste disposal pipe in an internal airshaft, with a view across to adjacent rooms. That is, if you can see through the window given how much encrusted bird excrement cakes it - check out the photo.Of all the hotels I've ever stayed in, this is I think the most depressing layout. I couldn't deal with that aspect of the room, so I returned to the front desk. Lula on front desk told me I could pay almost $600 to upgrade to a better room - still nothing special, not up to an average Marriott or Hyatt standard - and she literally walked away when I complained. The general manager Barbara Lopez left notes every night asking to be contacted if anything could improve my stay, but she never replied to my email.The bathroom had silverfish bugs - check out the attached photo. I didn't bother complaining at the time because of my horrible prior experiences with Lula and Barbara, but I showed them these photos upon checkout and they didn't care or offer me any sort of amenity, not even a discount on my $20 minibar.This stay was approximately halfway through a 120-night vacation at 4* hotels throughout the Americas. It was easily in the bottom 10% of my hotel stays. I've stayed in NYC hotels around 40 times this decade, and this was easily the worst experience of the lot.I was so looking forward to my first stay in a Thompson hotel. I'm now about as anti the brand as it is possible to be.Avoid this hotel unless you are paying for a specific room type - but if you're gonna overpaying that much, just choose a better hotel.
Oct 5 2008 	What a shame the designer of this place couldn't get quieter airconditioners	Funky little hotel in a great central location on Manhattan Island but our stay was ruined by a noisy air conditioner outside our window that the staff seemed either unable or unwilling to fix for the three nights we were there.Would have been nice if they'd offered to move us to another room, but no, we even had to get the bellhop to run down the street and get ear plugs so we could sleep.Would only stay here again if the room did not have an airconditioner outside the window.There are better hotels in New York for the price.
Sep 21 2008 	Great Staff/ Great Location	Unfortunately, we had to go to NYC last minute for a funeral. The staff was incredibly caring, especially Lula. We had four separate rooms which were all lovely. The sheets are amazingly soft. The decor is fabulous...watch out for the corners of the platform beds!Plenty of closet and drawer space and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic, as were the toiletries of the hotel. Starbucks is just next door so a Latte is never far away. Whole Foods is in a great mall across the street. Everything we needed was within walking distance, including Central Park. All in all, its a bargain. I would highly recommend 6 Columbus.
Sep 10 2008 	I totally liked it!!	This is definitely the place to stay if you're aim is to explore Central Park and hit the museums! I got a really good deal for around US $225 per night and it's worth it. Clean, modern, great amenities and amazing sheets!! Central Park is right across road and all the bright lights of Broadway, Times Square and Madison Square Garden are all within walking distance. This truly is a gem located in mid-town for the reasonable price you pay.
Aug 30 2008 	Nice Location...	We booked a Queen Deluxe room on Quikbook.com for $250. We were in room 95. The room was bigger than I expected it would be. The bed was perfect for 2....with more than enough room.
Aug 25 2008 	Finally a clean bathroom and room!	My mom and I stayed at this small boutique hotel right on Columbus Circle. This hotel is small, modern, and had a wonderful hotel staff. I had to upgrade to a bigger room and they were very accomodating. The bathrooms and the room itself was clean. It actually had this baby rose aroma smell that I just could not figure out what it was. The beds were clean and soft. I don't suggest large parties to stay here. The rooms are not that large, we came here to do some shopping and after 2 days it was getting pretty crowded. The location is pretty convenient. There is a mini mall and subway right across the street in the CNN building. Pinkberry is right next door for some yummy yogurt. And a block down is 9 Ave where there are tons of restaurants to choose from!
Aug 24 2008	Small but well designed rooms couldn't be more convenient	I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a simple, yet quality stay at a hotel in NY for a reasonable price. The decor is modern and pleasing. The rooms are indeed small but well designed with hidden storage spaces, like drawers under the bed. The Fresh bath products are a real plus as is the Blue Ribbon restaurant in the lobby. The location across the street from the Time Warner building and the Columbus Circle subway station is also super convenient. My only complaint - and the reason why I didn't give this place higher marks - was the full sized bed, which was a bit cramped for two adults. I booked the room through Priceline at a great price and specified two people. I'm not sure if it's normal for the hotel to book two people to a room with a full sized bed, but I'd recommend calling the hotel to make sure.
Aug 21 2008 	High-price...underwhelming.	After searching for a hotel with a good location in Manhattan for a &quot;reasonable&quot; price I booked at 6 Columbus. Most prices I had seen were upwards of 500/night and they had rooms at $345. I have to say I left feeling really underwhelmed and disappointed for the money I spent. Positives: 1. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. You really are paying here for location. Subway (59th street/columbus circle) right across the street, QNRW (7th Ave) less than 4 blocks away, Less than 1 block from Time Warner Center/Central Park. 2. Cleanliness--housekeeping service was outstanding. Drawbacks/Negatives: 1. LOUD doors that seemed to slam frequently after 1100pm. 2. Many of the staff were nice but it seemed like many were trying so hard to be friendly and helpful that at times I wasn't sure anyone knew what exactly they were doing. 3. SMALL rooms. I upgraded to a queen deluxe (having booked a superior) and it was tiny...with NO view. 4. LOUD water pipes. Anytime anyone used the water to shower the pipes were super loud. 5. LOUD A/C blower...I couldn't hear the TV when the A/C blower was going and especially not when A/C and water pipes were in use next door. 6. LOUD hum from pipes/fans outside window...if you are not lucky enough to get a street/park facing view and are stuck in the back you look out onto pipes from the adjoining buildings.Unless their prices come down or I could get a &quot;deal&quot;--less than $200 per night, I don't think I would stay here again.
Aug 14 2008	Bad service	The clerk at the counter refused to check us in because the guest who had occupied the room wanted to extend his stay for another night. They could not offer us another room (fully booked) instead we should stay at the Hudson hotel a hundred yards down the road for one night and come back the next day for the second night. We refused and asked for the manager in charge to complain about this unacceptable offer, but the clerk was the manager already. The manager emphasized that the Hudson had the same standard (that was a lie, as we found out later) and we could stay there for two nights. We did not like to spoil our holiday and accepted the change.
Aug 8 2008 	Nice hotel great location worth a stay	Stayed at 6 Columbus Aug 1-4 after getting what was apparently an introductory rate on Quikbook ($230 or so). The location is great (yes, it's not ON Columbus Circle, but barely 1/4 block away...not worth quibbling about) with the subway and Time Warner Center directly across the street, and the park right across the circle. The area is a lot less hectic than being further south, but still convenient.The staff was extremely nice and unobtrusive. The Queen room was very spacious for NYC, with a comfy bed, desk, flat panel TV, and a huge bathroom. It was nice to see a hotel think about the people who use their rooms and provide plugs on TOP of theThe interior rooms are a bit cave-like, since you don't have a window, but the lights have slider settings so you can make the room a lot brighter than the way the staff apparently sets it up in preparation for your visit. I'm not sure why people fixate on the dark hallways - I didn't run into anything, and unlike other hotels with dark hallways, the room numbers were lit up.Overall, I loved the hotel's style, comfort and location. I don't know if I would pay full rate, but in the $200+/- range this is a good NYC hotel that would make your visit to the city very pleasant. I would definitely stay again.
Aug 3 2008	Nice Stay for $200	I arranged my one night stay through Quikbook, at a rate of 199.00. With this rate in mind, I found the hotel very nice. It was clean, modern, safe and nicely located in Columbus Circle. The staff were friendly and fairly helpful for my few questions. The only drawbacks I found during my stay were the loud doors and cleaning staff that seemed to be yelling &quot;housekeeping&quot; all morning long. Minor issues...As has been mentioned, the rooms are small, there are no views nor real amenities. I would not pay the rates they list on their website (425 for the queen room etc.); even in Manhattan you can find a better room for that price. I only needed a place to sleep near Central Park for one night, and did little more than sleep in the room, so it was perfect for my needs at the reduced rate. Nice new option in the city.
Aug 2 2008 	Nice Stay but be Warned	My partner and I stayed at 6 Columbus Circle (not really on Columbus Circle) over the Memorial Day Holiday. After making my reservation I called the hotel and talked to Abbey to request high floor (street facing) which she confirmed. When I spoke to Abbey, I even reserved an upgraded room since it was my anniversary. Upon check in, we were given a SMALL room on the 2nd floor. Even though I complained to the front desk, I was told the hotel was full and nothing could be done for that night. The clerk at the front desk advised us that we could move the next day to the room that was promised to us. We were in the room until about 11:00 AM and no call from the front desk to change rooms. When we arrived back to the hotel later in the afternoon, still no call! I finally called the front desk and they had the nerve to advise me that they were ready to move us but we had not called them! Generally hotels that run efficiently would contact the guest and coordinate these types of activities. We finally moved to a room on the 10th/11th floor. The room was oversized with a large-ish bathroom facing the street. There was one day when housekeeping had not cleaned the room by 6:00 PM but this was quickly resolved without any hassle. One note, the beds that are used are platform so there is no box springs on the bed. Also, this hotel does not use top sheets, only a duvet (Iï¿½m sure this works well in Winter but not Spring/Summer). On the positive side, the location is EXCELLENT and Starbucks is next door. Each night the turn down service includes Voss water chocolate. A nice stay overall but with some problems and attitude from the front desk.
Aug 1 2008 	6 Columbus - Pretty Good	I was in NYC for a business trip and stayed at 6 Columbus for 2 nights.LocationThe property is right across the street from the ACE subway line and The Shops at Columbus Circle. It is a great location that is close just south of Central park and an easy walk to everything mid-town. Oh, there is a Starbucks next door too in case you need a caffeine fix.StaffALL the staff were wonderful to deal with. They were friendly, professional and helpful. You would think this is one of the basics.RoomI'll post some photos, but the rooms are a reasonable size. I wouldn't say that it was a large room, as the king bed just barely fit with the 2 side tables, but it was serviceable. No complaints.The view was the back of another building. I had the curtains drawn the whole time and thought it was fine. If you want a brighter room and a good view, ask for a suite in the FRONT of the building. The decor is slick, but I agree with the other reviewers in saying that it is a bit too dark. I like dark hip lounges, but would like the bedroom a bit lighter/neutral.The worst thing was the air conditioning system. It worked, but it was basically an on/off switch run by a thermostat. This isn't bad in itself as the temperature was kept at a comfortable level, but when on, it was LOUD. Really loud. I found it hard to do a video conference on my computer with the fan on...something that I've never had issues with in other locations. Room AmenitiesNicely furnished with Frette robe, Dean and DeLuca snacks in the mini-bar, and Fresh bath products are a nice touch.Hotel AmenitiesThe building is old and it shows its age. You can either think of this as quirky and charming or dumpy. I prefer the former. :-)It isn't a newly constructed hotel with a work out room, pool, etc. Not a big deal to me as I work out by walking everywhere while traveling.The hallways seem a bit dark...as do the elevators that are covered in dark pony skin or something. This is the hotel's attempt to be hip and slick. I can take it or leave it and would rather have brighter hallways and rooms.There is a pretty restaurant off the lobby that serves Japanese inspired foods. It is pretty vibrant at night. It is OK (not great), and a bit expensive... Nice atmosphere but if you just want good food, you can do better just by going on a short stroll around the block.Oh WiFi...like all travelers these days, I need wifi...and the hotel is smart to have fully blanketed the building with FREE wifi. A big plus! What's with hotels that still want to charge for wifi access after already gouging for the stay?OverallThis hotel has been greatly anticipated. The retrofit is decent but nothing really to write home about. A bit dark for my tastes.I thought it was a nice hotel and would stay here again. Great location, excellent staff, decent room. If you can get a good price, it is a good play to stay.
Aug 1 2008 	great stay in New York at the 6	I stayed at this hotel on July 25 and 26, 2008. The hotel is located at 8th Ave. and 58th St. across the circle from Columbus Circle and the Time Warner Center. I upgraded my room from a pod to a queen for an extra $35 a night. This made the rate more than I would have liked to pay as I had read posts where the rate was much better than I got but for New York it was a fair price. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful and great to deal with. The room was bigger than at the Hudson down the block but not really big. It was very well designed and pleasing to the eye if a bit dark. The bathroom was shiny and very modern with the right amount of room. The linens and towels were of an excellent quality and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was very clean. I would definitely book here again if I can get a good rate as the location is ideal.
Jul 27 2008 	Great Staff!	We are in NY at least twice a year for business. 6 Columbus was won on Priceline for one night. The second night we booked directly through the hotel's website.While the hotel's decor is a little too dark for our taste, the staff was outstanding. Everyone was friendly, professional and helpful. We would definitely stay there again just because of the staff and location.We upgraded our room to a king. We were told it was worth the additional $50/night. The room was still on the smaller side. Pros: Outstanding staff, nice hotel, great area, complimentary newspaper, nighttime, brownie at turndown. Also great Sushi restaurant. Cons: Decor a bit dark. Bathroom door is glass so if you have light on at night it shows through. Door to room is heavy and it is difficult to close quietly.
Jul 25 2008 	The Find of the Year	My wife and I spent four wonderful nights at this very trendy and elegant hotel for our honeymoon during the Thanksgiving weekend of last year. I had meant to write a review earlier, but I never found the time. Shame on me. This hotel was aesthetically beautiful, since it had only been open for around a month when we stayed there. The lobby is cozy and attractive. The rooms are both homey and artsy in design, although on the small side, which is common for Manhattan. You really have to get used to the bed corners, because you will end up banging your shins a couple of times against them. But no matter. The bathroom was comfortable and clean. The TV set was an LCD screen, which I liked a lot. The hotel is perfectly located around the corner from Columbus Circle, which makes it extremely easy to move within the city by subway, bus or just by walking. The staff was really friendly and attentive. All in all, we had a wonderful honeymoon and this hotel was a great part of it. I tried to book us again to celebrate our anniversary this year, but the rates have already gone up from what we originally paid (I paid $189/night... I guess I was lucky that the hotel had just recently opened). For those who can afford it, I highly recommend it.
Jul 18 2008 	I want to go back!	Stayed in this hotel for only one night, and I wish I could have stayed longer (for the same price, of course). We booked through priceline and got an AMAZING deal. The hotel is a little bit hard to find, the taxi driver could not find it, and took us around and we ended up paying more fare. But it's in a great location: Central park is right across the street and Times Square can be reached by walking down Broadway. There is a shopping center right across the street, but we did not have a chance to check it out. We stayed in the pod room, which is super tiny, but extremely clean and decorated really well. Even though the bed is a bit small for two people, it is really comfortable because of the pillow top mattress. The flat screen tv was great, but I would have liked to have maybe a little table or at least a chair to put things on, I think there would have been enough room for a least a chair or a luggage holder. I loved the bathroom, it was very modern and pretty. Toiletries, Q-tips and cotton balls. There was a safe in the closet, a bathrobe and an umbrella to use during your stay. I was disappointed though because there was no hairdryer. The AC in the room worked really well. The staff was great. I would recommend it to everyone and would definitely stay there again.
Jul 12 2008 	Sweet 6-Spot	I was pleasantly surprised by 6 Columbus. Having stayed a week at Soho sister hotel, Sixty Thomson last year, I was pretty reluctant to repeat the experience. But my sister and the attractive price point convinced me otherwise. And I'm glad for that.The location is super, right on Columbus circle, near every convenience imaginable. Unfortunately, most taxis had a hard time finding it, for some reason.I booked the basic room and expected something tiny, this being NYC. But I was happy to find that although small, it was spacious and had clever little storage spaces like underbed drawers. The service is pleasantly unpretentious, understated, accomodating and most imptly, inobtrusive. Loved the Fresh toiletries. Could have more of a variety though. Too basic.And although there's the jumpin' -- and delicious -- Blue Ribbon Sushi bar in the lobby, it was never too noisy, scene-y or happening, thankfully.I ate at the Blue Ribbon every day - sometimes twice a day - and once when i had some bad fish and became ill, they waived my bill and gave me a $100 voucher, with min fuss. Can't blame them completely though, traveller's diarrhea may have played some part in this.The room service breakfast, though was overpriced and horrible (burnt cold toast). Otherwise, a sweet little spot. I'm there next time I'm in Manhattan.
Jul 11 2008 	The Most Amazing Hotel!	I got the most amazing deal on Quikbook! The Bell staff, reception and concierge are all extremely helpful, not to mention very good looking. This is a trendy hotel!I also have to state that this place is SPOTLESS!!! I have never stayed in a hotel more clean than this, and it smells great too. When they turn your bed down at night you even get a mini brownie to eat with your night cap!I stayed in a Pod Room. Don't be fooled by the name, the room is a brilliant size. You get a double bed, more than enough floor space and a full size bathroom. The only downside is that there's hardly any natural daylight even though you have a full size window, it faces the shaft.The location is perfect, just across the road from the Time Warner Building and Columbus Circle subway and next door to a Duane Read, also a stone's throw from Central Park.If I can get another deal (usually the hotel is quite expensive) this will absolutely be my hotel of choice every time I go to New York. I pity the poor suckers paying way over the odds for a tiny room at the Hudson on the same road, 6 Columbus is miles better!!
Jul 8 2008 	Very Nice!	We got a great deal on this hotel through Quickbook ($200/night for a king room). The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room was very small, but for New York, it was fine. The location was great as well. Right across from Columbus Circle. There is a Whole Foods, so you can get anything you might need. The subway is there, too. Some things to be aware of:Room was tiny and although there was a desk and chair, it would be very awkward to actually have to work at the desk.There was no hair dryer or ironing board. I'm assuming I could've gotten these from Housekeeping had I needed them.The air conditioning is extremely loud. I got used to it, but if noises bother you, it might be a problem. We would definitely stay here again if we could get a similar rate. I don't think I would pay $300+, though.
Jul 1 2008 	The Staff Shines	Just returned from 5 nights at 6 Columbus. A few highs and lows, but overall very pleased. The staff from front desk to housekeeing couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The young men at the front door that help with luggage and cabs etc. were a delight. They were bright, polite, friendly, well groomed and well trained. Rooms are small, but well designed. Beds are very comfy! A small desk and chair in the rooms would make a great difference. Lighting in the rooms and bathrooms is very inadequate. Mood lighting just doesn't cut it when you're in the shower or shaving. Can't see instructions for use of the room safe on floor of closet because of lack of light. Overall, I liked it and would go back. Kudos to staff and people who picked and trained them.
Jun 2 2008 	Average NY hotel	I stayed at 6 Columbus for 3 nights in May. The hotel is fine for the price I paid, but there are better hotels for similar prices (the Hudson for example). Rooms are tiny as expected, location is great at Columbus Circle and near the park. The room was pretty clean (except for a strange goo on the bedside table!) and the front desk service was acceptable.If you can get a good deal ($200 for a queen room) I would recommend it if you don't need top notch service. If paying regular price, look elsewhere.
May 28 2008 	Perfect!	I booked through Quickbook.com...same day and got a wonderful $159 rate for a queen room. My husband and I had a wonderful time at this hotel. Pleasantly surprised! The location is wonderful...close to Central Park and Times Square. The staff was so helpful. Now about the room...very modern and nicely appointed! I slept like a baby in the bed. For NYC...wonderful deal...especially for a holiday weekend!
May 27 2008 	Stay now before everyone else finds out about it!	I stayed here this past Friday night, and was thoroughly impressed. For this price point, 6 Columbus is a great, hip choice. It has a kickass location (just behind Columbus Circle), which makes it very convenient. There aren't a lot of large-hotel amenities (such as pool or business centre), but it's high on design (blue/silver/brown trendy decor) and nice boutiquey touches such as Fresh brand toiletries. The staff is friendly, and the hotel small enough that you can get in and get out without long waits for anything. It's not for everyone, but if you like hip boutique hotels, you should definitely stay at 6 Columbus now...before all the rooms get trashed by overuse.
May 18 2008 	Wonderful stay at 6 Columbus	I've just returned from three nights at 6 Columbus. Having stayed at New York's Hudson Hotel a few years ago, I knew what to expect at this property, which seems to be similarly marketed to the young, urban, and hip set (not sure if that's me, but...). I had a Queen Superior room. It was nicely appointed, contained Fresh bath products in the bathroom, a heated bathroom tile floor that was most pleasant, a flat screen television hung on the wall, and a well-stocked mini-bar with top shelf alcohol and Dean and Deluca snacks. The room is not the largest room I've ever stayed in, but by New York standards, it was more than adequate. The bed fit in the room just fine, and when I'm in NY, I don't come to hang out in my hotel room.That said, my room could easily accommodate two people, which seems to be a point of issue for some reviewers here. There are two drawers for storage under the platform bed and a wardrobe for hanging clothes. Nice touches include an umbrella should it rain (it did while I was there so that came in handy), turndown service with a little mini brownie, and excellent (and adjustable) task lighting bedside and on the desk.There is a restaurant just off the small lobby, Blue Ribbon, that has sushi (It's okay. Some would say great. I would not) that somehow manages to also do room service and traditional American breakfast for the hotel. There are restaurants in the neighborhood, a pub next door, and a Duane Reade pharmacy/convenience store on the corner.I had difficulty adjusting the heating and cooling system in the room. It could be my own ineptitude, I don't know. The controls were those manual &quot;point the dial at the number&quot; controls. I am of the digital age: press an arrow up to a number or down to a number. Anyway, the climate in the room was perfect the first night. Then, it rained, which as you can imagine changed the humidity and outdoor ambient temps and all bets were off after that. I didn't call anyone to complain, and I still slept just fine.There is also a VERY small lobby which, particularly on the weekends I imagine (that's when I was there), uses music to assist in creating a hip and happening scene. The music can be loud in the elevator and in the lobby, but you won't hear it in your room. I guess that covers it. Oh, they seem to spray or pump in a signature scent, similar to what other hotels are doing these days. I find it pleasant. Slightly tropical with hibiscus notes, perhaps? Either that or they have some nice smelling cleaning products! While not offensive or in any way excessive, if you are sensitive to smells, be warned.The hotel is located across the street (W 58th) from the Time Warner Building at Columbus Circle. Great location. Overall, I would recommend this property and look forward to returning soon, probably next month.Happy travels!
May 11 2008 	GREAT Stay at 6 Columbus!!	I booked this hotel based on its location, price and traveler reviews (on TA and elsewhere). We stay in the city somewhat often, so we know space is at a premium and affordable rooms are hard to find....especially in good locations! I have to say, you cannot beat the location of 6 Columbus! Easy to find, it is just behind the Time Warner building with top notch shopping and dining just across the street. The subway station is also just across the street, making travelling throughout the city a snap. If you'd rather take a taxi, the doormen will happily hail one for you in a matter of seconds! Central Park is just steps away and on a good day, you can stop by Whole Foods (in the Time Warner center) and pick up fixin's for a picnic in the park......joyous! Yes, the rooms are small. We had a pod room and really, it took me back to my college dorm days! That being said, everything in it looked new and clean. The bed was super comfy and the heated bathroom floors were GREAT!! The fridge was well-stocked and the cabinet was filled with gourmet goodies. There was a small closet....and really, how much closet space does one need on a trip?? I never hang all my clothes when I go away....it was ample for us. There were 2 down sides that I can think of: 1) The lighting in both the bathroom and room were horrible for putting makeup on and 2) the room was HOT when we arrived, so we opened the window, but just beware of all the pigeon POOP ( I will say that in the days previous, it had been quite chilly!).The service was AWESOME! I really noticed how pleasant everyone was. When we arrived, our room was just being cleaned, so they happily stored our baggage until our room was ready...just a short 15 minutes later. When we called for an iron and ironing board, one arrived within 5 minutes!! The front desk always greeted us by name and were fast and courteous.I got a great deal on Priceline, so that was just icing on the cake. This hotel was WAY better than many of the others we have stayed at for double the price! I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone!
May 6 2008 	6 Columbus was Fabulous!	My boyfriend and I stayed at 6 Columbus for four nights at the beginning of April and had a fantastic stay. Now I'm considering it for a trip in the fall with my sisters. When we got to the hotel, we were greeted at the taxi cab's door by the very friendly doormen. I have to commend the hotel on the doormen they have working for them...what fantastic and friendly personalities they all have! Our room wasn't ready upon arrival, so the manager gave us complementary drinks at the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar - a great little bar to frequent before dinner or when you come back from a long day of shopping (get the grapefruit cocktail listed on the menu!). This simple gesture was a great indication of the stay we were going to have.Once we got up to our room on the 7th Floor, we were surprised at how cozy and lovely it was. The room was small (I believe we booked a Queen Superior), but that is normal in New York, and neither of us were bothered by it. There were cute little touches all about the room - magazine racks with up-to-date publications in them, like Time Out New York, a vase with a real flower on the nightstand, an i-pod dock, under-the-bed storage. The bed was lovely, and very comfortable. Every night we slept very well. The bathroom was a good size with a deep tub, so no showers overflowed onto the floor. There was a window/shelf in the shower to place your toiletries. The toiletries - by Fresh - that the hotel supplied were fantastic. The towels we so fluffy! OH! And the best part of the bathroom - the heated floor in front of the shower area! It was fantastic in the morning to step onto a heated floor and I even found myself standing on it after our long days of walking.My only &quot;issue&quot; with the room is that after we both showered, the room itself got rather humid and muggy. The location of the hotel was fantastic. There was a subway stop right across the street where we could get downtown very quickly. One of the nicest things was being able to get up, grab a coffee at Bouchon Bakery across the street, and take a morning walk in Central Park. I had reservations about staying uptown, but ended up being very pleased with our location because I liked having the access to the Park, the Upper East Side, and being able to get downtown to Soho so quickly and easily.As I said up above, I am already considering 6 Columbus for a trip in the fall and would recommend it highly! From the staff to the comfy towels and bed to the fantastic location, I could not have picked a better place to stay!
Apr 30 2008 	6 Columbus A Thompson Hotel	Absolutely loved this place. Will definately stay there again. Service was excellent. Linen, towels, bath rob....flat screen TV just like at home. Staff are very friendly and very cooperative. Had a blast
Apr 30 2008	Uncomfortably small	I booked this hotel for two nights, but left shortly after arriving. The &quot;King Superior&quot; room is the tiniest NY hotel room I have ever (almost) stayed in. It is uncomfortably small, to the point of claustrophobia.There is a floating desk against one wall, but no chair to sit in - nor even would one fit between the desk and foot of the bed. The bathroom is basic and, although renovated, is crowded and equally uncomfortable.
Apr 29 2008 	Wonderful Experience at 6 Columbus	We just got back from a long weekend in New York and a wonderful stay at 6 Columbus. Firest let me say that the concierge Rocks! Raquel and Eric were amazing at setting up a series of events for my partner's birthday celebration. Everything was perfection. The room at 6 Columbus was very large for New York. We booked a Studio Suite which had a balcony almost as big as the room. Everything about 6 Columbus is very cool. The room lighting/linens furniture and bathroom are all top notch. Blue Ribbon Sushi was fatastic too! I would highly recommend this boutique hotel for anyone who likes a little &quot;edgy swank&quot; in the hotels.
Apr 11 2008 	Superb find!	We spent 13 nights at this fantastic hotel. Originally booked a deluxe King at an excellent rate on Perfect Escapes but found a great deal for a suite on Tablet Hotels web page although we stayed in a Studio King on our first night. Long story but handled very well by the hotel &amp; we loved that room too. It was huge with a balcony &amp; enormous bathroom &amp; good view of a corner of Central Park but we decided to move to the suite. We were given the choice &amp; it was a hard choice actually! But the rooms of the suite were very quiet, beautifully appointed with clever design features &amp; gave us plenty of space for a long stay &amp; overlooked 58th St &amp; the Time Warner Center with a glimpse of Central Park as well, &amp; exactly as portrayed on the hotel's web site. Nadia kept it in great shape for us during our stay &amp; it was lovely to see her smiling face every day.The delightful Julian welcomed us on arrival after our long flight from Australia, charming Caeser showed us to our room &amp; greeted us by name every time we saw him again. As did everyone at this gem of a hotel including Ciaron &amp; Stan who run a fabulous bar &amp; helped make our stay so fantastic, along with Richard &amp; all the staff at the marvellous Blue Ribbon Sushi restaurant where we ate several times. Terrific menu, sublime food &amp; decor &amp; most reasonably priced.Getting around NYC was as easy as. Great subway across the road literally seconds away but anytime we needed a taxi Anthony &amp; Parry were always on hand &amp; must be two of the most affable doormen in town....aside from the others working at this hotel.Room service swift &amp; not at all expensive for a hotel of this stature &amp; location and neither was the well stocked mini bar. Free internet &amp; breakfast downstairs in the mornings...which we never got to eat! Too many laughs at night in the bar! This was my 6th time in NYC. Have stayed in a variety of hotel types but wanted to try somewhere new. Doubt that I would ever stay anywhere else again unless rates go through the roof which they might well do. Then again I would probably pay them as we had such a magnificent time.An easy walk to theaters, Whole Foods across the street for a quick bite, Chemist &amp; Starbucks next door &amp; anything else you might need close by.We are kinda fussy travellers but appreciate service par excellence &amp; a hotel that turns out to be what it portrays to be. No wonder we can't help but be blown away by this wonderful stay at 6 Columbus. Spend the extra for a suite, studio or deluxe room &amp; have a ball! We feel indebted to everyone associated with this hotel &amp; wish them continuing success
Apr 2 2008 	Stayed March 20-24 and can't wait to return.	We chose to stay in Six Columbus because of the great location and reviews found here at TripAdvisor. I would recc. this hotel to those looking to explore the city and indulge themselves at a boutique hotel.The hotel was very clean and the staff was quite helpful and courteous. The location is top notch directly across from the shops at Columbus Circle which houses a Whole Foods which is perfect for a tasty and inexpensive breakfast. Next door to the hotel is Starbucks, a bit further you will find a Duane Reade and Dunkin Donuts. You will find Central Park 2 minutes away and Times Square is a quick 12-15 minute walk from the hotel. Many subways are literally found right outside the front door of the hotel.We had a weak wireless internet signal that was not protected, minimal noise from inside or outside the hotel, newspaper each morning and the best mini-bar and snacks I've ever seen. Our room was a good size - Queen superior and loads of space for all of our luggage.The few downsides we noticed were:The heater did not heat up the room (I wanted 82 and it would only reach 69). I had to sleep with a hoodie on for two nights to keep warm. We notified the front desk twice and upon check out we were told it was a problem within the entire hotel and they were working on it.Very strange that the cleaning staff NEVER left the right amount of towels - not even when we checked in. First day no hand towels, then no face towels, then again no hand towels. Very strange, but housekeeping quickly bought up the towels when requested.Lastly, we could not get a seat in the bar or dining area on the two nights we tried. Yes, we could have called ahead, but as a guest at any other hotel I've stayed in this has never been a cause for concern.Even with the few downsides, I'd stay here again.
Apr 1 2008 	Great Location Nice Hotel	Found this hotel mostly by reviews on this website and others, and due to the fact that it had a really nice daily rate compared to other, trendy hotels in NYC. I have lived in NYC but not visited much (and usually stayed with friends and family when I did) and therefore have very little to compare this to with regards to other Manhattan hotels. Overall my wife and I really liked the hotel. The room was very nice, clean, and with a comfortable bed and a nice TV. It was also very small with a view of an airshaft and a tub made for a Hobbit. Having lived in a small place in Manhattan myself this did not bother me much, but I can see someone not used to such cosy quarters having trouble with it. Only other problems were that they kept having laundry delivery problems resulting in not having washcloths for two days... Also give you the Post (the Post??) and the Wall Street Journal is in the lobby; are they also in the Rupert Murdoch empire? To be fair they did offer to send someone out to get me the Times, but it wasn't worth having to tip the same price as the paper. The location is great with easy access to A,C,B,D,1,2,3 trains, Central Park, Midtown, and UWS and the Village. I was really impressed with the bar at Blue Ribbon Sushi (bartenders were awesome) and the food was good. Unfortunately the sushi was inferior to the fried chicken which was great. Go for the alcohol. Overall it was a nice week and a nice hotel. Would definitely stay there again if for no other reason than it is a nice place in a good location.
Mar 30 2008	Great Location	We stayed at the hotel because we had reservations for dinner at Per Se. The location can't be beat - it was across the street from the Time Warner Center. The employees were very courteous. There is a Duane Reade (or Rite Aide or similar drugstore) right next door in case you need something the hotel doesn't provide. When we checked in they said they were upgrading us to a King Deluxe, but the bed was not a king. Not a problem since the room was not too small. We were too exhausted to complain. Bathroom is decent with heated floors (but only half the floor was heated, by the sink but not in front of toilet or shower/bath). Fresh bath products. Turndown service at night. Inner rooms look out onto rooftop or shaft area. Loud AC unit from nearby buildings may keep you up at night if you are a light sleeper. Subway stop across the street. Whole Food Market in the TW Center has a great food court for a snack to go. Right next to Central Park.
Mar 18 2008	Way Too Small For Two People!	i cant belive this is a 4 star hotel!! yes the service was very nice and helpful but the room was just silly, i would say maybe 90sf!! i did not know that you could have a 4 star hotel with a full bed(two adults cant sleep comfortable on a full bed!!) no chair! no storage space (had too keep cloths in our luggage and store it on the one small window sill over looking a ally) the bath room was so small you had to step out just to dry yourself and there was not even a place to put your soap or shampoo!! very thin walls also, hard to sleep when every time sombody gets off the elivator or opens there room door it is so loud it wakes you up!! maybe it was that i booked on priceline and they put us in the worst room in the hotel!! but looking on the web site and the regular prices that they charge it is way way overpriced!! $400-1200 a night for a glorified closet!!! i dont think so!!
Mar 17 2008 	6 Columbus a winner (for the right price)	My wife and I stayed at 6 Columbus for a Sat night in March 2008. The hotel looks like its brand new. Its a smaller building on 58th and 8th Ave, but right off of the famous Columbus circle and on the corner of Central Park so the location is quite central to midtown and upper west side. The stylings are quite modern and the staff were very attentive. We were upgraded from a pod room to a queen size bed for free which was great. That said, the hotel is a very small building, and the rooms are a little smaller than average, but two people don't really need more space than that. What matters is that the hotel is clean and brand spanking new. I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples with no children, but probably ONLY at the right price. I've heard the hotel rates average around $300 and up, but I got a greal deal on perfectescapes.com for $145 for a pod room. These may not last long as the hotel gains more and more popularity.
Mar 11 2008 	Excellent return trip to the 6 Columbus!	I have stayed at the 6 Columbus 2 months ago and decided to book again this hotel because I had liked my experience there. I also booked this time through quikbook, which is the way to get the best rates. I had given it a 4 star last time because I had trouble sleeping 2 of the 4 nights. There were rowdy boys next door and even if I called the front desk, the manager could not get them to quiet down. This time was totally different. I did not hear anything even if I was near the elevator. There are not many rooms per floor so there is less chance of people walking by your room. I booked the queen room this time because there were no pod rooms available but when you are alone, one or the other will do just fine.The staff is simply the best. I arrived at 9:30 in the morning and was given a room right away. Almost all the doormen recognized me and welcomed me back warmly. They treat everyone the same and that is the biggest compliment I can pay them. They don't cater to only the trendy clientele, they cater to everyone..even if you are not a 20something model:)The staff in the restaurant is the same. The manager Quint and the barmen, especially Keith, treat you warmly and I was even offered a nightcap when I stopped by in the evening before heading to my room. It is a great plus for the hotel because you feel like lingering there even if you are on your own. They take great care of you. I would love finding something to complain about because then I could write to the manager and hope for complimentary nights in return, but I can't find anything negative to say about this hotel. I just fear that I will not be able to afford it much longer when their prices will surely go up.d
Feb 26 2008	Loved The Room And The Location	If you a regular vistor to nyc you'll know that hotels are very expensive and you probably use craigslist to sublet. well that's what i normally do - but i found a really good rate on the hotel's website - 145 dollars for the standard room per night. now it is small - but where it lacks size it makes up for other things. the location is perfect - i walked everywhere - even in the snow. it's right by the subway - and if you take the train to the airport - that's just 2 dollars and 45 minutes on the express train...it's right next to my favourite store - wholefoods - so i was in their everyday. and then right by the park and near all the shops on fifth avenue. the staff are very young - and trendy - but very helpful. the room was very nice - clean and excellent minibar. there was a complimentary copy of the new york times everyday - and that's the only way to get news outside the states - unless of course you watch cnn!!!1the bathroom was cool - heated floors - and fresh brand cosmetics - watch the shower - very hot - but lovely then you can wrap up warm in the cosy bathrobe.all in all for 145 bucks a night it was great - i would definitely go again - but if i stayed longer or with someone else i would go for a bigger room.oh yes the bed was lovely - too
Feb 25 2008 	Small but very cool	Did a last minute trip to NYC with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in a &quot;Pod&quot; room which was quite small but very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a normal size. The entire hotel has been redone is very chic. The hotel bar is small but cool. And, you are right across the street from the Time Warner mall/building....and right by the park. We got a great rate of $125/night from www.quikbook.com and couldn't pass it up. I would highly recommend this property. If you require space, do not stay in the Pod room. We didn't plan on staying in our room very much, so it met our needs.
Feb 20 2008 	nice little hotel!	I was very pleased with my one night stay at 6 Columbus. They had a minor computer glitch which caused a brief delay in my check-in (no more than 5 minutes), and they upgraded me to a &quot;deluxe&quot; room to make up for that. The staff were very friendly and made a point to address me and other guests by name (even the bellmen). The room was small but very comfortable, and the bathroom amenities by Fresh were a nice touch. At the $199 rate I got on ---.com, it was a good deal and I would definitely stay there again.
Feb 19 2008 	Great experience at 6 Columbus	Had a great stay at 6 Columbus in January! I found the staff to be very nice and attentive. The decor is fabulous in the lobby...It's got a very young, hip vibe. (Also had great food in the restaurant--Blue ribbon.) The rooms are small w/ no view (at least for us), but that's what I expect in New York...But, all of the elements in the room were nice...great linens, a flat screen TV, fresh products in the bathroom. My only complaint might be that we were close to the elevator and I heard it in the morning.Overall, great experience. So nice that I'm sure I won't be able to afford it when the hotel is completely finished!
Feb 7 2008 	Excellent beds wonderful design good location!	Surprised by excellence of this hotel; welcoming staff, nice atmosphere (good music everywhere), lovely design and heavenly beds. We've booked the hotel directly and did get a good deal for a hotel of this category. Location was good because of many metro-connections, nice area with many locations for breakfast (Pain Quotidien etc). We were very happy to have been staying in this upmarket area instead of Times Square and other midtown locations
Feb 6 2008 	Absolutely unbeatable for the price	First off, TripAdvisor needs to immediately correct this hotel's one-star rating as well as its average &quot;$802 per night&quot; rate. Both are skewed on criteria to which I am not aware.I am a former native New Yorker, and I've stayed (both before and following my move) in a variety of the city's best hotels ... as well as a few of its worst. Including this one in its previous incarnation, where I had the displeasure of seeing mice periodically pop their heads through holes in the pink shag carpet. (I only wish I was kidding.) Thankfully shag and mice have long since dispersed.I received a rate of $145/night -- for a queen room, not one of the now-infamous &quot;pods&quot; -- via booking directly through their own Web site. Even considering the nosedive NYC hotel rates take in January and February, that's a total steal. That said, my room was nonetheless very small, and I banged my shins on that infernal platform bed on multiple occasions. I also had some issues with my A/C-heat system, which is the only reason I'm not giving this place five stars.The location next to the Columbus Circle subway stop makes it a perfect juncture for reaching most areas of the city via subway, and although it's too cold to appreciate it this time of year, I'm sure its location practically next door to Central Park will prove a major bonus as well.Blue Ribbon, for those of you unfamiliar with the city, is one of its best &quot;minichains&quot; (with only 4-5 total), and the 6 Columbus location is its first uptown. I ate there and was highly, highly impressed: it's some of the best sushi in a city filled with formidable sushi restaurants, including the infamous Masa across the street.Sadly, it looks like management is already onto the fact that they priced the rooms too low: their winter rates are already up 50% (to $215/night for this upcoming weekend - on their site, not Quikbook).
Jan 3 2008 	Big thumbs up all round !!!! (visited from UK)	We visited NYC from the UK for a 5 night stay at the end of November/beginning of december and the hotel was excellent put simply!The staff are really friendly and helpful (down to earth friendly not [-] kissing friendly!). They all were polite and we enjoyed chatting to them as we left in the morning and returned later in the day. Concierge was really helpful right down to booking a table at a sushi restaurant for us a few blocks over when we realised the one downstairs was closed on Mondays....We had a pod room, which did face the building at the back but ultimately it's that or the busy street at the front of the hotel- I know which one I'd prefer (and did!). It was adequate size wise as was the bathroom (heated floor and powerful shower were just the job after being out all day). The bed was massive and possibly the most comfy we've slept in! Flat screen tv was just the ticket as was the ipod stereo on the bedside table.location wise the hotel can't be faulted. We ended up walking most places as nothing was more than a 20 - 30 min walk away really- time square was about 20 mins max, 15 if you didn't have to keep stopping to cross the roads. And if that sounds alot believe me there is more than enough to keep you entertained walking around! Yellow cabs could be got right outside on those occasions we didn't fancy the walk, on our final day we got a yellow cab down to the Staten Island ferry port for about $18 then spent the afternoon walking up to the hotel stopping for coffee and shopping along the way. If you walked it with no stops you'd be looking at 1.5 hours or so.Sushi restaurant and bar are super cool (as the hotel in general really), pastries and coffee in the morning in the bar watching the world go by is a good way to start the morning, and tasty sushi in the evening in relaxed surroundings a good way to end it.The one negative was that the room we had was at the end of a corridor (with two other rooms)- some nights we got a bit of noise (lift door &quot;ding&quot; or a door slam). This was reduced by closing the door that allowed access to the three rooms so all in all not a big issue.We used a generic hotel booking website so got a decent deal. I'd happily recommend this hotel and make a return visit in the future. When we go to London we stay at a hotel called The Hoxton and this hotel is very similar in style, atmosphere and comfort.All round excellent.
Jan 3 2008 	Too small to bother	While the staff was very friendly and service oriented, this was one of the most ridiculous of the 100+ nights I have spent in a NYC hotel! In my first room (which was so small, I hurt myself when I turned around) the telephone didn't work. After 3 visits from the non-English speaking &quot;facilities guy,&quot; the apologetic front desk clerk gave me a new room. While this room was no bigger, at least it didn't look onto the airshaft covered with pigeon droppings. All was well until I returned to my room at 11:00PM and tried to turn on the heat to take the chill off the 60 degree room. No heat. No facilities guy. No other rooms. No luck. While the Sushi restaurant in the lobby is &quot;happening&quot;, it was the only kitchen functioning. Breakfast was stale pastries and lukewarm coffee while room service was a 3-ring binder of NYC delivery services. If you are a fasting Liliputian, this is a great place. Otherwise, go down the street or around the corner.
Dec 27 2007 	Perfect!!!	Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 6 Columbus. The hotel is situated midtown, opposite the Time Warner Centre and within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and all the important shopping streets. The hotel is small and intimate, the staff are very attentive and the concierge is very helpful. He arranged a fab night out for us and put us on all the guest lists. I was expecting a pokey room given the reviews, but the 'Pod' room really wasn't that small... the room comes with a very comfy bed, designer edibles, ipod docking station, flat screen and the bathroom even has heated flooring( oh and an amazing power shower).The hotel houses a very popular New York sushi restaurant, the food was pretty decent. The hotel is on the same street as the Hudson hotel( pay a visit to the bar) and also the Mo bar at Mandarin Oriental( the view of the city is amazing).All in all, can't fault this hotel. Does everything a hotel should, very comfy, central location and excellent attentive staff.Will be my New York sleeping spot going forward!!!
Dec 20 2007	wonderfull rooms	In this area of NYC a hotel with less ambient music and vivid as the neighbours from the Hudson. Breakfast and dinner was a bit disappointing (for Europeans?) but the rooms were fantastic. Spacious, very clean, quiet. To go back!
Dec 17 2007 	Quick stay at 6 columbus	I decided the visit NYC for a friend's party last minute. 6 columbus was offering a rate of $258 (total!), so i decided to check it out.the hotel is located at the southwest corner of central park, directly across the street from the time warner bldg. 5th ave is within walking distance, as well as other typical NYC attractions. it is very conveniently located.The hotel staff were absolutely charming. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself is well designed visually... a sleek and attractive space. My room was a &quot;pod&quot; room. it was quite small, as was expected, but perfectly clean and well designed for its purpose. The bed was very comfy as well. my only critique involves the insulation of the room. I was in room 72, and the wind was quite loud. you could also hear doors opening and closing, etc. I will certainly return to the hotel, but maybe next time i will bring some earplugs. ;)
Dec 4 2007 	Fantastic Hotel!!!!	This hotel was brilliant. On arrival, the doormen asked for our names as we were a party of 6, and took our bags inside. When we were checking in, the manageress came out and asked was it OK that she had upgraded all of our rooms as she had seen it was a girls holiday!! Of course we said yes!!The rooms were spotless and the beds and pillows were the most comfy i can ever remember in any hotel I've stayed in!Each night the room was turned down and towels, toiletries and water was replaced.It was so close to Central Park, and the Time Warner building across the road has some nice shops and i would definitely recommend the Porter House restaurant in there too!We got great rates for this hotel on Quikbook.com and if i am lucky enough to get back to NYC, i'd definitely stay there again!! Well worth a visit!
Nov 12 2007 	Nice additon to midtown	It was a busy week in NY and I had trouble finding a room at a good hotel (I'm picky) so I decided to give 6 Columbus a try. The staff is well trained, the doorman asks your name when he takes your bag and then radios inside so that you are greeted by name at the desk. As I came and went from the hotel, I was always addressed by name. I arrived around 1pm and they were able to provide a room then. I had a queen deluxe room. It did face the narrow alley but I would much prefer that to the noise of 58th street. There is no view on 58th, it is a narrow street and looks onto the glass building of the TimeWarner center. The room size is typical of a NY boutique hotel - small but comfortable and well appointed. I'd rather have a smaller nicer room than a large yucky room. (If you want large and yucky, I can give you that list.) Everything is new and clean which is always a plus. There is a small wardrobe instead of a closet so don't overpack but it is adequate. The bathroom is small also (I had one with a tub) but manageable once you figure where to put things. It might be a little cramped for 2 people, depending on how well you like each other! The doors are heavy and do slam loudly so in the morning if you are not an early riser you'll probably hear them. Each room has it's own central ac/heat which is nice and not the norm in New York. Unless it is a new building or completely renovated, you don't have much temperature control in many NY hotels. I like having my room cold at night and toasty in the morning so I appreciate the unit. But I do have to mention that the fan is very loud but it makes for good white noise for sleeping and drowning out slamming doors. The pictures on the hotel's website are accurate. There is a japanese/sushi restaurant in the hotel which was good but when it's not open, you have to go out which isn't really a big deal. But if you like to have room service in the morning, this isn't the hotel for you. There is coffee/tea and pastries in the lobby until 10am but you have to fetch it yourself. I have stayed at/checked out many hotels in the area and this one is probably one of the nicest. The Peninsula and FS are my favorites but taking a step down from those, if this is the area you want to be in, I'd recommend it. Since it's a new hotel without much history, you can email me if you have a specific question.
Nov 2 2007 	Perfect place after venturing through the streets	I stayed at this place with my girlfriend for three nights. After trying to find a place that would suite our needs for this trip for more than a week I finally came upon the 6 on Columbus. We reserved a Pod Room (due to our limited budget) and were completely happy with it. Upon arriving we were greeted by extremely polite staff. Everybody working for the hotel was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.The room was very clean, nicely designed and comfortable for two people who use it as a place to relax after hitting the streets of New York. In the morning we found coffee and a selection of good tasting baked goods in the lobby. The location of perfect. It is in walking distance to everything in midtown Manhattan right on the SW corner of Central Park. A subway station is across the street. There are several shops and restaurants around. We would stay here anytime again.

Nov 19 2009 	Great locationcomfy roomshelpful staff.	My wife and I had a week in NY staying at 60 Thompson.While a lot of the staff may have been chosen on their looks never the less we found them helpful and accommodating.In particular the concierges were always willing to help with bookings and advice.The restaurant on site,&quot;Kittichai&quot; is beautifully set up,with good service and excellent food.Our room on the 7th floor was reasonably sized, comfortable and quiet.Being removed from the hustle and bustle of uptown and in the midst of the quirky appeal of Soho is a definite plus.
Nov 19 2009 	An experience - best service in New York	We spent our honeymoon here and it was a fantastic experience. The room was clean and really nice, the beds were fantastic, and the service at this hotel is excellent as well as the location. If you are going to New York - this is the place to stay. I will give a few examples of what we experienced:- the concierge got us into some of the hippest restaurants and bars and upon arrival not only booked a really nice restaurant but also told THEM that it was our honeymoon so when we came to the restaurant they had arranged for champagne on the house and wished us the very best! (note: we have stayed in other hotels on Manhattan, essex house is one of them, but we have found that few hotels knows the meaning of a real concierge - but this! This is excellent. They know Where to go and they can get you there and this is really good value when you are in a city like New York)- everybody working in the hotel was really serviceminded and nice. And they remembered who We were.- fantastic room: clean, designerlook, Kiehl's products in the bathroom as well as bathrobe (We only missed slippers) - great food in the restaurant. the breakfast is really good - try it!- the location: the hotel is situated in a quiet street (so no noise at night) and still you are just a few footsteps away from everything: the restaurants, the bars, the clubs and the Metro.Next time we're going to New York - this is where we are staying!
Nov 14 2009 	Great Location Small Room!	This is the hotel to stay at for amazing location. Steps to Central Park, Radio City, Columbus Square, and very close to Times Square, this hotel was an ideal location for a visit to NYC. The room was small, very small - and we had upgraded to a queen. There was no closet, only an armoire, and therefore we had to call up to request an iron and ironing board. That being said, the bathroom was quite lovely and spacious. But really, in NYC, room size doesn't matter...because you should not be in your room except to sleep! Go out and DO something! The people working here were lovely, and the hotel was very very clean. The hallways were a bit dark, but serviceable. We took advantage of the free luggage storage before our trip back home. WiFi was $10 USD per 24 h.
Oct 27 2009 	60 Thompson is not a Boutique Hotel !	I was there for 3 nights to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. After a 7 hour drive we were at the front desk at 2:30 and check-in at 3:00, not a room avalaible.Very cold welcome by the receptionist that we seemed to bother. We had a king size room but don't bother to pay more since all the rooms are the same (very small) and the only difference is the size of the bed. Very noisy hotel where everytime a guest closes a door it makes a terrible noise. You can also hear everyone in the hallway. I'm a member of Small Luxury Hotels (SLH) and I travelled everywhere in boutique hotels. 60 Thompson IS NOT a boutique hotel. For example, even though I wrote to the management few weeks before our arrival telling them about the special occasion, nothing was made to highlight the fact. Is it too much to ask to have a small note in the room ? There is a very nice roof terrace but it's only open from 5:30pm. It would be great to enjoy the quietness of the place, the view, a drink at anytime of the day. If you need to use a computer, you'll have to use the small one on the front desk, standing in the middle of everyone. The only goog things are the friendly welcome from the doormen and the location.I wouldn't pay more than 200$ for this hotel. It was 400$ + 55$ for parking. Ridiculous...
Oct 8 2009 	This botique didn't have the charm I was looking for	Spent one night here in early October. Was disappointed - room was small (though typical of an NYC hotel room), amenities were limited, bed was just OK. Teh worst part, however, was how noisy the hotel was: the bar at reception was cranking music until 3am on a Wednesday night... The toilet flush was like the Hoover Dam unloading... And worst of all, teh bottom of my door wasn't very well sealed off, so hallway noise (and - yuk - secondhand smoke!) intruded all night.I slept from 3am until 6. I figure it was $150 an hour. Not coming back.
Oct 1 2009 	60 Thompson is fantastic	I stayed at 60 Thompson in September 2009. Everything about it was fantastic -- the location, the rooms, the staff, etc. The design of the room is beautiful, and it was a good size, especially for a NYC hotel room. You can't beat the location, since it's in SoHo. You can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, shops, etc. My room overlooked the street, but it wasn't loud at all (at least for me).I'd definitely recommend 60 Thompson!
Sep 12 2009 	Great Hotel and Immpecable service	We stayed during the third week in August and had an amazing time. The hotel is located in the middle of Soho which is perfect for shopping and dining. The rooms were nice sized and very clean. The hotel is getting a little dated in the rooms but it does not detract from the stay. What impressed me most was the service and friendlessness of the entire staff from the front desk, to bellman, cleaning staff, etc. Everyone was helpful and accomondating and made us feel like we were family which in todays travel is not found frequently. We will be back for sure!
Jul 24 2009 	great location	Nice little boutique hotel in the heart of SOHO. Nice bars, great staff and very knowledgable about everything you need from shopping to restaurants. Great area to stay for a romantic weekend away from the tourist frenzy of Midtown. Enjoy!
Jul 20 2009 	Lovely Winter Escape	We stayed at 60 Thompson in Dec 08 for a pre-Christmas escape to New York. Everything about the hotel was fabulous! We flew in early morning and the reception kept track of our room and phoned us as soon as it was available even though is was only 10.30am. The room was well equipped, clean and very comfortable. The concierge really knew their stuff and were always only to happy to help out. The hotel isn't only in a great location but it is surrounded by cafes that serve fantastic coffee, tempting boutiques all with a great village feel. I wouldn't stay anywhere else!
Jul 12 2009 	Pretty good overall	I don't have a good track record of picking hotels in New York and so when this one was recommended to me by a colleague I thought I might as well give it a shot.Overall, I was not disappointed. Arrival impression was not great because at street level is the restaurant; reception is upstairs and I was not offered assistance with my luggage. Furthermore, both receptionists were on the phone when I arrived and so I waited longer than I would like to check in - which after 8 hours travelling is not welcome.Room itself was clean and looked fairly recently updated, bed comfortable, decent bathroom. As with most NYC hotels, pretty small though.I didn't have any noise issues (another common problem in NY).Breakfast quite nice.Wall Street is about a 25min walk away.Certainly worth considering.
Jul 1 2009 	Disappointed	Luxury Hotels website sold us the idea that although the Hotel was away from other bar scenes, this hotel has two very popular cool bars to enjoy. When I checked in I was excited and could not wait to try their roof top and inside bar. On our first night we were very disappointed to learn that both bars were closed for PRIVATE EVENT so we decided to go somewhere else. On our second night we wanted to have a drink in the afternoon before getting ready for dinner and again the bars were closed til 9 pm. Well they lied after having dinner and looking forward to coming back to our hotel to enjoy the facilities, the inside bar was supposed to be closed for a PRIVATE EVENT until 12:30. We waited in the lobby until 1:30 am and they would not allow us in. I found it very insulting to be paying top dollar for a hotel whose premises are closed for other events. One of their employees told us that they frequently rent the bars to a local company that books events for them. In conclusion, the hotel was very nice but if the only available part of the hotel is my room, I rather go somewhere else.
Jun 24 2009 	Great service but the hotel is a little tired.	We used to stay here when the hotel first opened. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms were clean, but tired looking. Furniture has stains. Lobby had a strange gas smell. Restaurant was okay.
Jun 16 2009 	Nice hotel in a great location	I had actually stayed at 60 Thompson's sister hotel, 6 Columbus, in January... which proved so gloomy with such bad lighting that you almost needed a white stick to manoeuvre about your room. 60 Thompson is quite different... and a much better experience. I had a light-filled room on the 11th floor, which afforded a really great view over SoHo. The location is really excellent. It's so nice to slip straight out the door into such a vibrant neighbourhood. The staff were excellent. The doormen were extremely attentive and there was one woman on reception, who was particularly professional. The bar is cool and they serve nice cocktails, and the design of the room is very pleasing. On the negative side, the breakfasts are only so-so rather than excellent. The choice is pretty limited and the price a little steep. The other thing I found quite strange was the fact that there was not a desk in my room. I can not be the only traveller, who has work to do while I'm in New York. I mean, it is a city with business travellers... not a spa or a resort. So, I thought it was pretty weird that I had to sit uncomfortably with my computer on my bed. I inquired and was told that there were only desks in the suites. The other big problem I had during my stay was a very poor Internet connection. At times, I actually had to sit on the floor near the door just to get reception! I asked them if guests regularly experienced problems and they said &quot;No&quot;. Given the pluses at 60 Thompson, I'd almost definitely give them the benefit of the doubt and return on my next trip to NYC.
Jun 15 2009 	Accomodating friendly great bars!	Spent the weekend with friends for my birthday. The visit started shaky when I was not able to present the manager with a Comp Voucher that I didn't realized I needed. Staff stayed calm, let me work through what I needed to do. And then in the end did what they needed to do to help me have a great weekend. Loved the friendliness of the staff. Roof top bar - gorgeous, Thom Bar lots of fun and Kittichai amazing! Highly recommend!
Jun 10 2009 	This must be one of the best hotels in NY	After reviewing what seemed like hundreds of hotels for our NY trip, we decided upon 60 Thompson - and we're so glad we did. It must be one of the best in NY and I would definitely recommend it. All the staff couldn't do enough for us - the doormen were always friendly and concierge/reception staff also always helpful and friendly. We tipped the doormen/concierge/housekeeper when they helped us with things (~ $10 each time), but I believe this is the norm for NY, so it didn't seem strange.I could rave on and on about this hotel, but it really is an amazing hotel in a really good area. I agree it is a typical hipster nouveau trendy hotel, and slightly (not &quot;vastly&quot;) over-priced, but I think you get what you pay for and at 60 Thompson, attention to detail and customers was spot on throughout our week long stay, which means more to me than paying less for sub-standard service.The rooftop bar is lovely - the perfect setting for a cocktail or two after a long day shopping, and the restaurant was also very good. I'm not a huge thai food fan, but it really was good.The only niggle I had while I was there is the first room we were given was really noisy - direcly above the bar (which, incidentally is a lovely cozy, comfortable place), but we asked to be moved and no sooner had we asked, we were moved to a higher floor which had a larger, brighter room with a better view. I believe this may have been a superior room, but we weren't charged any more than originally quoted. Oh, a niggle of my husband's is the mosquito bites he received while sitting next to the trees in the bar at the front of the hotel, although this isn't really the hotel's problem.If you are considering staying in this hotel, ignore any negative reviews and go for it - you won't be disappointed.ps - we had no problems with the air con!pps - really good restaurant Antique Garage around the corner on Mercer Street.
May 21 2009 	Great hotel in a fantastic location with staff who make me feel at home.	I stayed there twice on a merry-go-round US trip trip last month and loved every minute of my experience.The rooms were stylish and modern, with all the extras you would want in a hip hotel.Located in the heart of Soho, i couldn't have asked for a better location to hit all of my favorite downtown shops and restaurants.The staff were particularly gracious and welcoming, especially the pretty Avery Bock who's Front of House for the evenings activities; Steven Jacoby, one of the many great doormen; and
May 6 2009 	Vastly Overpriced Hipster Hangout	To be fair, I never actually intended to stay here. I was supposed to be booked into their sister hotel the Gild Hall down in the Financial District and my assistant swears that's what she did and the problem was on the Thomspson central booking site. Oh well,. My plane was late, it was raining, my car service didn't show up and I arrived at the Gild Hall 15 minutes before my scheduled meeting and ws told that my reservation was up here. The taxi took 15 minutes and the credit card payment system didn't work so I walked into 60 Thompson with literally no cash in my pocket and late. The aura is typical hipster nouveau trendy with lots of Euro music going on and and so I pretty much knew I would have a small room. At the desk the man said my room was &quot;ready&quot; but not available because it hadn't been inspected. That was because of the late check-out. I said &quot; Huh&quot; I never heard of a check-out as late as that and in any even I was late and they should give me anothert room. They didn't and kept me there about ten minutes while they finally processed me into what on of the front desk people called a really good roomThis is not a really good room It is a standard modern small room with King bed and small couch and chairs and bureau and flat screen. No desk to work at (but if you are a true hipster, I suppose, desks surplusage). The bathroom is nice and there is a large shower and no tub. The WiFi works for $10/day.As I dropped my bag and flew out the door to my meeting, I noticed it seemed warm in the room and so set the thermostat at 68 F. I returned at 9 pm and found the room hot and called down to the desk. They said they would send somebody up to &quot;fix' the thermostat. Instead, they sent a maintainance guy who was carrying a standing fan! I said, no, what I wanted was for somebody to make the air conditioning work and he opened the windows for the time being and went away. When he returned he told me that they had &quot;turned on&quot; the air-conditioning in the hotel - in fact, it had been turned off for the whole hotel because somebody complainted that it was too cold. Huh???? Finally I got some air conditioning. A later call for a wake-up rang unanswered about 20 times before I quit.This is a perfectly adequate $210 hotel. It takes real chutzpah to ring you up for $345
Apr 21 2009 	Mixed feelings	The good 1. Friendly staff: Most of the people we encountered were polite and helpful. I mean the staff at the front entrance, front desk and the restaurant.2. We like the location. It is in a neighborhood setting. Within walking distance to restaurants, cafes and shops.3. Restaurant: good food and service.The Bad 1. When we checked in, we were shown our room. Everything looked fine. However, when we came back from dinner, the room was FULL of SMOKE. We hurried to the front desk to tell them that someone smoked in our room. They said they will send a supervisor to inspect and they will let us know. Nobody came back to explain what might have caused the smoke:(2. A few friends met with us in the lobby/lunge area. My husband moved 2 chairs closer to us so we could chat with each other. A woman (blond) came over with stoned face to tell us we were not allowed to move the chairs. Upon hearing that, the group of us started discussing maybe we should go somewhere else. As we were walking away, the same woman came over to tell us that we could go and sit in the corner. I told her we have decided to go somewhere else. She got UPSET and said RUDELY:&quot; I wish you had told me before I moved chairs for you!&quot;3. During our first day of stay, we left ï¿½no disturbï¿½ sign on when we went out in the afternoon. When we came back, there was a message under our door. It said they didnï¿½t do the turn down service because of the sign. The second day, we made sure the sign was off the door when we left. When we came back at night?... Still no turn down serviceï¿½Mixed feelingsï¿½
Apr 15 2009 	Friendly service	We recently stayed at 60 Thompson and I must say it was one of the best experiences we have ever had at a hotel. The staffs are good looking but very well trained. From the moment arrived to the hotel we were greeted and welcome and the warm greetings continued through out our stay. We do not remember ever having to open the main door because there was always a doorman there to greet you. The concierge (Chris) is fantastic and knows just about everything about NYC. The desk staffs are ready to greet you once you step of the elevator in the upper lobby. The housekeepers are very polite and always greeted us while awaiting the elevators. We love everything about this hotel. The only negative was the street was being repaved by the city and it was very loud causing us to request a roommove to the other side of the hotel but unfortunately they were fill for the night and could not accommodate us.Many thanks to 60 Thompson staff, you're our new favorite in NYC and we will back soon
Mar 20 2009 	Alotta Moolah	Pros: fantastic location, hip, trendy, clean rooms, good toiletries, friendly at the desk; great chocolate boutique a few doors down. Cons: snooty door guys (stepped right in front of us as we were returning from dinner one night and, with a total attitude, asked my boyfriend &quot;can I help you?&quot; when we told him we were guests of the hotel, he just stepped aside, with no apology; rooms are microscopic (but this is typical for NYC). Overall, no real service for the amount you pay. We like Soho, but will probably try somewhere else when we visit again in May.
Mar 14 2009 	Love the place	Great hotel, friendly staff, amazing rooftop bar, chic lobby bar.Certainly a preference over Mercer.
Feb 1 2009 	Fantastic Service; Trendy But Slightly Worn	I just stayed at this hotel January 2009. The service (hotel staff) was fantastic. The location is perfect. The restaurant is incredible. The room was a little worn out (stains on some of the furniture, kind of dirty pillows on the bed, and beaten up fabric on the couch). But the room (a Deluxe King) was tastefully decorated and large for NYC. I would definitely return.
Jan 28 2009 	Finally a great service	Finally a hotel with a quality serviceI've been recommended to stay at Thompson 60 by friends and I do not regret at all.First, the hotel has a perfect location, second, I was amazed by the quality service (front desk, bellmen and specially concierge).The team is ready to answer fast, efficiently, to customers' needs and the professionalism of all team is incomparable.I worked in the hospitality businessl, and it is obvious that all team followed a training of remarkable quality.I've stayed with friends for five nignts, and rooms are so comfortable with great accomodations specially the bed.Thank you for giving to your customers a big comfort, service and a young efficient team...P.S. beautifull bar and restaurant
Jan 23 2009 	A good choice	My brother and I stayed there for a quick business/family visit trip in November. The hotel is...really nice. I can't think of anything to complain about. The design isn't groundbreaking, but it is still comfortable and well-done. The location is...perfect. Great shopping, eating, drinking are all just steps away. it's also easy to meet up with friends from all over the City.Our room was much larger than I expected (and who ever says that about a NYC hotel?). It's also nice to be in a busy part of town where the hotel doesn't feel like Grand Central. Also, make sure to eat (even just a snack) at the Thai restaurant on the ground floor...Kittichai?...it's great.
Jan 14 2009 	Funky Chic Soho	I stayed at 60 Thompson for one night this Jan. Overall the hotel has the &quot;w&quot; hotel feel but much more upscale and personal. The inviting second floor lobby is decarated well with huge windowns and funky furniture. The check-in process was quick and all of my requests fullfilled.The room itself is a pretty standard NYC size room.. We checked in put were called in our room right away due to a mix up with someone else already checking into that specific room. We were upgraded to a suite that included a HUGE living room, seperate bedroom, 2 seperate bathrooms, each with walk in tiled showers and seperate tub. The suite was really something else. If you can afford it, it has to be one of the best in the city. Even though we were in the suite, I did see the previous &quot;standard&quot; room and it was like stated before: typically sized for NYC and decarated very funky/chic. The beds were very comfortable and showers fantastic.  I would and will definatly be back
Jan 4 2009	Great location average hotel - stay if you get a rate	The hotel has a great location and the staff are friendly and helpful, rooms pretty clean (although we needed to open the windows in December to let some fresh air in as it was pretty stale when we arrived). Then there was a leak from the room above and we had to move to another room. The reception rooms are a bit dingy. Overall, if you can get a good rate, it is worth staying here, but doesn't feel like it is worth the full price.
Dec 11 2008 	So overrated.	I recently stayed at the 60 Thompson for work.The hotel itself is pretty. The main floor with the bar is clean and elegant, not too designy but modern and minimal. Lots of dark wood, very Thai insipired. The staff is very nice and well trained and certainly try to make everything as smooth as possible. However, when you get there they give you an explanation speech on the special hotel amenities. At the end of the day the special amenities are a bar and a restaurant - and that's it. My room - which was supposed to be a superior king at 549.00 - was a closet. It was so small, I can't even image what the standard rooms look like. The room is minimal, pale greens and greys. Nice - but nothing special. If you stay in these kinds of hotels they all kind of look like each other after a while. There was nothing particularly distinguishing. The bathroom is nice and big. Dark marble - but shower only (in case you like to take baths). The shower amenities were the bare minimum - nothing special. Shampoo, conditioner and a bar of soap. No shower cap, toothbrush etc. Turndown service is nice in that they give you a brownie on your pillow. The &quot;gym&quot; - let's call it that - is in the dark, dank basement. It is an even smaller room - say 8 feet by 8 feet, with low ceilings and no windows. 2 treadmills, a bike, and an elliptical machine piled on top of each other. There is no business center and if you need to use a computer - you are forced to stand at a tiny laptop at the check in counter. God forbid you should have people waiting. Or worse, have to wait yourself. I have to say it's the first hotel I've ever been in without a business center.The room service was a little unusual as well. Minimal - but way too minimal. I ordered the grilled chicken breast and literally got a sliced grilled chicken breast on a white plate. No bread, no salad, no decoration, no condiments. I got that they were going for minimal, but looked more like hospital. All food is Thai inspired so even the chicken noodle soup and the grilled chicken breast had a very strong Asian infusion flavor to them. The breakfast &quot;buffet&quot; is really non existant. 5 bagels, 5 croissants and some toast on a plate. The menu looked ok, but i just wanted something simple off the buffet and sadly there wasn't much of a choice. So all in all - nothing bad - but certainly not worth that kind of money, or buzz. I think if you want to stay in this neighborhood I would recommend the SoHo Grand which really has all amenities a proper hotel should have.
Dec 1 2008 	Great Place	Hubby and I just returned from a fabulous long w/e trip into Manhattan and stayed at this lovely hotel! There is not one thing I can negatively say about it! Everything was fabulous from the doormen, front desk, housekeeping, the wonderful bed and bathroom!!!! I did make a mistake and thought I was putting the A/C because we had our curtains opened and the sun made our room extremely HOT! Turns out there is only 1 setting from the Winter and the summer and when I put it on Cool it was actually heat and when we returned to our room hours later is was about 150 degrees! One call to the front desk and a couple of laughs later a maintenance guy came up and got our windows to open wide to cool the place, which happened in minutes! Again, this was MY fault not the hotels! Everyone was extremly nice and the hotel is in a perfect location as my husband and I frequent SoHo and the Village!!! (subway is right around the corner to go up to Midtown also).One more thing...we arrived on Thanksgiving Day and Thompson Street had plenty of parking! We were there for 3 days 2 nights and if we had to garage our car it would have been over $100...just be patient and look around for the right spot and watch your signs for street sweeping, etc! My car was actually good for another 3 days (but sadly we had to go home)!!My photos look exactly like those already posted so I'm not going to bother.
Oct 27 2008	uniformly good service	I have stayed in NYC each of the last 10 years for my annual photographic trip. In recent years i have moved down from midtown and stayed in Soho at the Mercer and Soho Grand. This time i went with my family to 60 Thompson. The hotel is excellently positioned for the immediate area and lower Manhattan yet in a quiet road. It's rooms are bigger than most but whilst I believe service levels in most NYC hotels are better than the uk, 60 Thompson was exceptional. One felt relaxed and at ease. I can also recommend the City Girl Cafe across the road for a great coffee and the Thom bar if you're feeling sociable.The only minor quibble is that the roof terrace was closed for the season which was disappointing as i had planned to take photos, but it's only a minor point.If you want a very comfortable, classy and not overtly trendy base with extremely helpful and friendly staff for exploring the less touristy lower Manhattan then this hotel fits the bill.Simon 49
Sep 24 2008 	EXCELLENT but worn around the edges!!	Excellent location with good shopping and restaurants all within short walking distance. It's easy to get cabs and feels safe. The hotel itself is a bit of a destination for party people, so request a room on a high floor to avoid the noise from the bar and restaurant.. or prepare to party!! we we're moved after a simple call to reception. The rooms are small and a little worn and tired, but have everything, including an expensive mini bar with everything including sex aids!!! The staff are friendly, polite and efficient, which is a real bonus for a trendy boutique hotel in NYC! We would definitely go back.The restaurant is very good.
Sep 18 2008 	Great stay in Soho!	I stayed at The Mercer last year in Soho and wanted to try somewhere else and 60 Thompson didn't disappoint! Substanially cheaper than The Mercer, 60 Thompson is just as convenient and the rooftop bar is a MAJOR plus!! Loved it! The FRESH amenities were so fab that I had to go the Fresh Store and purchase more shampoo to take home to Sydney with me!! And the bedsheets were to die for! I look forward to checking out the other sister hotels as I've stayed in 2 of them now and I have no hesitation in going back there again :)
Aug 29 2008 	Good but perhaps not as good as their prices promise	We stayed at 60 Thompson in April and had a perfect stay there. We were re-bookend into this hotel as the hotel we originally chose had to close their doors for a short time.When we first got there, we immediately liked the lobby and it was nice to get a coffee with pastry there every morning before starting a new day in that great cityNice room, big enough, just redecorated so everything nice and new, perfect bathroom and we slept wonderfully. Extraordinary, to be able to sleep so well in a city that never sleeps. The only noise we heard was our neighbour coming ' home' .Can't rave about the staff, they where average in my opinion, they did their job and nothing more than that.During our stay, there were still some renovations going on, so neither bar nor restaurant was open. We did get the rooms at about a third of the going rate, probably due to the rebooking and of course because not everything was ready. I imagine the bar and restaurant to be really something, but I don't think that ' extra experience' is worth $600 or more.We enjoyed our stay very much but it is definitely out of our range now.
Aug 24 2008 	Friendly 	Thank you 60 Thompson!My GF and I recently stayed at 60 Thompson for a special weekend get away and let me say it was one of the best treats we've given ourselves this year! (and it's already august)The staffs are all very friendly and welcoming and actually listen and pay attention to the guests. We mentioned at arrival that it was a special weekend get away for us and when we got to our room later on, there was a note from the front desk staff with bottle of red wine and fruits (can you say mood setter!)Tiffany was the young lady at the desk who greeted us at arrival, so i believe she had all of her co workers initial the note to us, wishing us an enjoyable weekend. But let me note however, another young lady greeted us at departure and she knew of our weekend get away and extended an invite for next yea r. The concierge desk was very helpful as well (thns Bryan for all your help) and guy at the entrance too. Amazing staffs, great location- We will always be back!
Jul 21 2008 	great location friendly staff	between Broome and Spring street this is a good location to explore the shops of Soho and the eateries of Greenwich village, Little Italy + Chinatown. Rooms have a reasonable size and free wireless access . I've stayed there for two hot and humid days in July, enjoyed the friendly check-in and especially the roof top sun deck and bar.
Jun 27 2008 	Fabulous NYC Hotel in Soho	60 Thompson is a charming boutique hotel located in Soho. The location is ideal for all the shopping and restaurants in Soho. The rooms are clean, spacious (for NYC), and well decorated. The bathrooms are beautiful and bathrobes are provided.There is also a very cool bar and restaurant in this hotel. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.I would absolutely recommend this hotel - its one of my NYC faves!
Jun 5 2008 	Huge Room bit noisy though	took me a long time to decide on this place, and it was between here and the gansvoort. The location is great but other aspects meant it was really VERY expensive for what it was.Staff excellent and friendly at all times, especially the bellhops.I chose the delux room and it was large with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was nice and the loo had a fierce and loud flush. Accoustically you could hear noises from the other rooms as well as the people in the hall.I would recommend it but i am not sure for that money, that I would return. The area is great !
Jun 1 2008	A hip boutique with great food and drinks	I only spent one night at this hotel, but I can certainly say that I left with the wish to return. Great location within walking distance to Chinatown and shopping in Soho. Convenient to 2 subway stations. When I checked in a bit early on Sunday, I got upgraded from a Queen Superior to a King Deluxe on the 3rd floor, room 32. Very spacious room with a couch. The upgrade was nice, but the room smelled like smoke - I found out during checkout that the 3rd floor is all smoking rooms, so request a room on a different floor if this will bother you. The Fresh toiletries in the marble bathroom was a nice touch. They also had Kiki de Montparnasse items in the dresser drawers (lubricants, condoms, etc.) - naughty! There was a disclaimer in the drawer that said that if the item is opened, then you will be charged for it, but when we arrived, one of the Kiki kits was clearly already opened (but not used), so housekeeping did not replace it properly. In the evening we went to the A60 Rooftop bar, which you have to show your key to get into if you're a guest. Otherwise, I believe you have to be a member. There were 2 sides to the rooftop bar, one that had the actual bar and was already full according to the bouncer, and the other which had table service. Nice views of the city. But don't go there hungry, b/c they don't serve food on the rooftop. For casual appetizers, head to the Thom Bar on the lobby floor (2nd floor). The Bar has a masculine feel, like a mix between a library and hunting lodge, with dark wood and modern furniture. There was a dj spinning ambient tunes. The chocolate braised shortribs were to die for! Excellent food and great drinks muddled with fresh fruit, although they took a very long time to arrive, and I downed mine in 2 seconds (not much there). Very friendly reception staff. Great food, good drinks. But I requested ahead of time that a special note be left in our room upon arrival for my friend's birthday, and they did not deliver on this, so the custom touch was missing. Housekeeping also took a while to bring extra sheets.Overall, a memorable experience. I would give 60 Thompson another stay upon my next return to NYC.
May 8 2008 	Great Location; Disappointingly Average Hotel	Stayed two nights in April with my wife, who accompanied me on a business trip. I spent a lot of time in advance of the trip trying to decide where to stay. Knew I wanted to stay in SoHo to be near my sister who lives there. My sister typically refers people to the SoHo Grand, but LOVES the rooftop bar at the 60 Thompson. A client who is in the hotel industry, spends a lot of time in NY, and is otherwise &quot;in the know&quot; recommended either The Mercer or 60 Thompson. At the time I initially checked availability, The Mercer was full and - even it they were not - the rooms were significantly more expensive than 60 Thompson. However, a couple days before I left for the trip, rooms became available at The Mercer and the prices between the two hotels got a bit closer. I stuck with 60 Thompson b/c I didn't want to spend the extra $100 a night. I regret doing so.60 Thompson is in a nice, quiet location still close to all the shopping and restaurants. Rooms are acceptable in size given they are at a boutique hotel in NY, adequately finished and clean -although not very interesting. Check-in was a little strange. We arrived early, so we gave them our cell number and went to shop and grab a late lunch and drinks. While we were out I called to see if we could upgrade our room from a King Superior to a King Deluxe, as I was having reservations about being in their standard sized room. I was told by the reservationist that a King Deluxe was not available, but, as she hung up, she confirmed that we were remaining in our original reservation &quot;which is a King Deluxe.&quot; Before I could clarify whether she meant to say &quot;King Superior,&quot; she hung up. I immediately called back to clarify whether we were remaining in a &quot;King Superior&quot; and whether she was correct when she told me there weren't Deluxe rooms available. This time I was told by someone else that I was being put in the Superior but Deluxe rooms were available and we could upgrade for an additional $50 or so, which I elected to do. Very minor, but I was surprised that there was this confusion given how small the reservation department was. My wife and I also remarked how beat up the lobby was. This is one of the first things you see when you arrive at the hotel. It really sets the stage for what you expect of the rooms, restaurant and bar, although I think the rooms, restaurant and bar are all in significantly better shape than the lobby. You'd think they'd keep things looking nice. Instead, it looked like wall and floor coverings and furniture had not been touched in a few years. Doormen did a nice job getting us transportation and loaning us umbrellas as we headed out in the rain. Service in the bar was acceptable. I left 60 Thompson disappointed. Not b/c it was a bad stay, but b/c I was expecting something just a little nicer, hipper and more special. When I go back I will either save a few bucks and stay at the SoHo Grand or splurge a few bucks and stay at The Mercer in the hopes of getting the experience I was hoping for at 60 Thompson.
May 7 2008 	Nothing special	I've just returned from a weekend at 60 Thompson from my husband and to be honest we were a little disappointed.The roof terrace was closed for refurb opening sometime later in May, not a huge issue but a shame.Firstly, we had originally booked a room that was 1 up from a standard. When we arrived in our room, i was really shocked as to how small it was - you couldn't swing a cat. The room was quite drab with no character whatsover. We stayed in that room for 1 night then upgraded to a bigger room. Much more spacious but again, I don't think it was value for money. This is a 'no frills' hotel as far as I'm concerned. There are many more 'boutique' hotels in NYC that would offer much more.Location is great. We ate in the restaurant. Great food, but i felt they rushed us to be honest.Bit of a hit and miss too with the staff. I called up at 1am for some tampax, the receptionist said she'd get back to me, never did. I just thought a phone call even to say they couldn't help would have been nice. We only stayed in the bar for about 15 minutes. It was really loud and buzzy but can't really comment further than that.Some area's of the hotel are shabby too.Toilets flush is so loud that it sounds like the loo is going to take off!!! All in all, not a hotel to rave on about. I think i'd recommend it for dinner, but not way would i ever stay there again.Hope this helps!
Apr 6 2008 	Good place to stay in New York	The 60 Thompson enjoys a good location, which is relatively quick to reach by taxi from JFK (as compared to Midtown hotels for example). It is not in the middle of SoHo action, which makes it a relatively quiet place. Yet, all the hot shopping / dining / drinking spots of SoHo are within walking distance, as is a subway station.Rooms are rather on the small side (but this is New York, after all), and the views are far from great (especially if you don't have a room facing Thompson Street). There is free wi-fi internet access, which is very convenient. The design of the bathrooms is great, and the bath amenities are good.Service is okay, as is dining. The bar is pleasant.Overall a nice place to stay, with a rather residential feel. I tend to think that prices are a little bit high for the product, but again ... this is New York, so that I would consider that the value for money is okay.Although maybe not my first choice in New York, I would probably stay there again.
Mar 21 2008	Good Location	I really like this Hotel, 2nd visit good location with lots of bars and street cafes around. Good cocktails in the bar in the Hotel and good service. STAY HERE
Mar 13 2008 	Excellent	Everything was wonderful.great location walking distance to all shops and amazing restaurants. beautiful and spacious rooms, everything we asked for was there within minutes.We only had breakfast there which the price was outrageous for coffe, juice and muffin but other than that i would recommend the hotel.Beautiful lobby and lounge downstairs, very good staff.Enjoy your stay.
Jan 16 2008 	Couldn't use the bar !	60 Thompson in NYC is an attractive hotel and the staff are stylish and attentive. However when I stayed there in December one thing amazed me...for three of my four nights in the hotel the bar was closed to residents as it had been hired out for private parties. If you wanted a drink you either had to sit in the lobby or the tiny bar of the restaurant downstairs.&quot;Completing the whole Thompson experience are the beautiful Thom bar and A60&quot;...clearly this was an experience that i did not get. When you are paying the best part of $700 per night you want to be able to drink in the bar. To be told that it is owned by a seperate company is pathetic...if you dont control it, take it off your website. To add insult to injury they sent a bottle of average champagne to my room...of course, in Soho that is exactly where you want to drink...in a room on your own!!!!In synopsis, what a crap experience for your guests...worst of all there was no warning and when friends joined me for a drink i looked like a tit in that i could not drink in my own hotel.
Jan 12 2008 	What a find!	WOW! That is all I can say. What a fabulous find in a great Soho Neighborhood. The rooms were large, clean, and modern. The staff was awesome! I was there with my Husband and 4 year old son on a last minute Holiday treat before heading back To CA. We were going to stay close to JFK, (only a 30 minute cab ride the next morning) but why, this was a great idea, and we will definately be back.
Jan 10 2008 	Loved 60 Thompson	I thought this boutique hotel was great. Please take into account that I love boutique hotels and made it a mini hobby to stay at as many as I can. I stayed in the Standard Room and I really enjoyed my stay. The Front Desk was great. I arrived early but there were no rooms ready so while I was off eating lunch, they called me and told me they checked me in (it was around noon) and they were ready for me. Also they gave me advice on reserving a table at the rooftop bar so I wouldn't be left standing if I didn't want to. Sadly, it was a breezy NYC summer night so it made the rooftop bar not so great. The amenities were awesome. They were by fresh. The bathroom was fine. Water pressure isn't that great but not a problem. They turndown your beds daily and leave a brownie from The Fat Witch which is one of my fave brownie places in NYC. They offer at turndown to fill your ice bucket, etc. Yes, the room is small. The smallest out of all the NYC hotels I've been to up to that point, but I usually get rooms with 2 double beds, so the comparison is still difficult. This was the beginning of my boutique hotel endeavors and the one I stayed at prior to this was Bryant Park. I enjoyed 60 THompson much better and I'm really a downtown girl rather than uptown so this fit me needs perfectly. Since the bar is on the 2nd floor, it can possibly be noisy, but I think I was on the 11th floor or what not. So it was quiet and peaceful for me. I was also in the room right next to the elevator and never found it to be a problem.
Jan 7 2008 	Sleepless in Soho	I just came back from a pretty terrible stay at this hotel, fortunately only for one night. One sleepless night that included crappy service, that is. I was in Soho with some friends celebrating a birthday and we opted to stay at 60T because of the proximity to our activities in/around the neighborhood. I got a decent rate due to the season: $455 (tax incl) for a queen double. My room was on the 3rd floor -- which I should have realized is right above the bar. Ordinarily this may not even be a big deal, save for the fact that at this hotel the bar was totally packed and they pump music until 3am. Speaking of the bar, what a nightmare. We went down there for a drink before dinner and when the hostess was no where to be found, we went in and encountered several empty tables with &quot;reserved&quot; signs on them. Eventually she wandered out and rudely told us that we could stay there until 9pm, but then she'd need to kick us out. That was at 7pm, and she seemed exasperated when we said we were only having 1 drink. We stopped by to see if we could get an after dinner reservation before we left, and she stood there ignoring us while hanging up coats for a few minutes before I &quot;interrupted&quot; her. Though we should have gone elsewhere, we actually closed down the bar at the hotel, which was okay given that had we chosen to go to bed, we wouldn't have slept with the music going so loudly. What really po'd me, however, was that at 6am people started getting up and flushing toilets which sounded like they were right next to you. The noise from these was amazingly loud and of course lasted through the morning. Our friends on another floor said they were awoken by it as well, and that it actually sounded amplified! I think their walls are made out of tissue paper and spit! Otherwise, the hotel seemed okay. It's not like you get much in NYC for your money. The neighborhood is great. The rooms are small, but everything is brand new. There's a crappy flat panel tv on the dresser, and a cd player/stereo in there too. (BTW, does anyone use cd's anymore?) The toiletries in the bathroom are pretty good. The beds were pretty comfy, with decent linens, which obviously didn't make up for the no-sleep dilemma. I should probably also mention that I was surprised at how clumsy and ill-trained the bellmen are. Though they always seemed to have 2 guys on duty, rarely were they around to open the door or help with bags. They sure love tips though! ;^)During check-out I mentioned that the hotel was really loud and the desk clerk, who also checked us in, kind of snickered and said, &quot;Oh, well, you were right above the bar.... &quot; Nice!I just glared out her and replied, &quot;Well, you checked me into that room so you must have known that. Regardless, we closed down the bar, that wasn't my issue. Your walls are so thin that every time someone flushed the toilet it sounded as if I was in their bathroom with them.&quot;This was met with no response. None whatsoever. I mentioned that I was from DC and that they have another hotel opening, to which she cheerily replied that 'yes' they did. Most hotels would offer something -- at least an apology when you told them your stay sucked.Or maybe I'm just used to good service?....
Jan 3 2008 	Very common place for a very high price	The location is really good but the hotel is so common...We took a king deluxe room with a rate of 679 per night. The Room was quite clean but very oldish and had nothing special.When you pay that price, you expect a little bit more than that. Last year we went to the Mercer wich is about the same price but much better and also in Soho.
Jan 1 2008 	Terrible	I was looking forward to staying at 60 Thompson because of the great location, but certainly would not repeat that mistake again. The tiny, somewhat outdated room was like sleeping in an oven - 90 degrees with no way to adjust the temperature except opening the window and thereby introducing the scream of police cars, etc. off 6th Ave. Staff was useless. Easily one of the worst nights I have spent in a hotel anywhere in the world. I left as soon as possible. You would be a fool to choose this hotel. You'd be better off gettting a bench in the park.
Dec 27 2007 	Great location great staff but a little worn	We stayed at 60 Thompson for a short Christmas get-away. For Christmas shopping the hotel's location in SoHo cannot be beat. And for seeing all of the Holiday sites uptown, there are several nearby subway stops. As compared to its equivalents uptown, the hotel's SoHo location makes for a more relaxed and quiet stay. The hotel's staff is very accommodating and answered all of our questions. The bellhops, concierge and front desk persons all went above and beyond to be helpful. Really, can't say enough good things about them (but they really should get a vacation once in a while, saw the same faces at all hours many days in a row). That all said, absent a discount, the hotel's price is well beyond what is reasonable for a hotel that has not been recently updated. The carpets are worn and although clean, bear the marks of many, many guests. The one-pipe heating system makes for an almost uncomfortable stay if it's unseasonably warm. And the beds could be a little more plush. However, if you have a good discount, the 60 Thompson is a lovely little hotel for the price.
Dec 16 2007 	Delightful boutique hotel in the village	Never having been to New York before, we were faced with 'where to start?' We wanted to get a flavour for 3 - 4 days, so wanted something central, comfortable, personable, and reliable. Trip Advisor reviews led us to 60 Thompson, and the hotel's website was attractive, so we gave it a go. We booked one of the executive rooms, and was not disappointed, given that the reviews led us to expect smaller rooms likely in need of a brush-up. The journey from JFK was a flat $45 in a yellow cab, and check in was fine. The front desk looked a bit untidy, but the young staff were friendly and cool. The room was fine. Crisp linens, clean and tidy, fresh. The place has a really good bar. Music is funky but not overly intrusive. Great long island iced teas! We only used the restaurant for breakfast, and we found this excellent. I recommend the home made meusli. Mostly very healthy options. Service on the whole was professional, unobtrusive. The location is perfect for walking around Soho, Grenwich Village, Little Italy, China Town, and is about 30 minutes from the financial district / ground zero, or depending on how many zillions of detours you make, can stroll up 5th Avenue for all the hullaballoo of the big shops. We'll be back. Warmly recommended.
Dec 14 2007 	Not so luxe!	This property was a second choice to the Mercer which was full. The 60 has been around sometime, and the rooms show it. I had a deluxe king room which was spacious, but with a very small coat closet. Bathrooms need to be updated, and very basic. Towels we thread bare, and felt oh so Comfort Inn if you get my drift. Amenities by Fresh were not replenished and limited. The turn down service of Voss water and a brownie were a nice touch. But did not make up for a rather &quot;oldish&quot; room.The room had no writing desk, but a large sofa and seater with a coffee table. Although it did have a flat screen television, it has not caught up with the wi fi must have making it cumbersome to plug into the the net, with a plug tucked in the corner.Airconditioning felt so European -- that is since its winter, its all heat! What happens if you want some cold? I slept with the windows open (they open about 3 inches). I could not complain about the service. The bellmen were very helpful (oh yes, with large tips) and attentive. The concierge abit snooty, but passable.Its all about location, and the 60 fills that need. But if you must be in Soho as I just love to be, I would not stay again but make sure to book early for the Mercer.
Dec 5 2007	Awesome Stay	Had a Christmas party nearby and decided to spend the night at this hotel to avoid having to make the commute home. I really enjoyed the room's amenities, except for the price of course. I guess this is the norm these days in NYC and it is nice to splurge once in a while. I would definitely recommend this hotel as long as you can afford it.
Nov 24 2007 	Great hotel in a great location	My wife and I decided we wanted to visit New York for a little pre Christmas shopping, 60 Thompson was recommended by a few friends, searched the hotels website and thought it looked pretty neat.............looked on TA and found a number of varying reviews, decided that I would go on our friends recommendation and how glad I am.The first impression is that it is in a very quiet location, I was glad of this after a couple of days fighting the crowds around Times Square, the hotel staff were great, from the check in to the delivery of luggage to our room, we were on the 12th floor, the room was great, bigger than expected and well decrated, even had a view from the window.Most days we were out early to do some sight seeing or more shopping but on our last morning we decded to have breakfast in our rooms, the food was great and there was so much of it, as usual for a Brit we ordered just a little too much but boy it was good.I will definately go back and stay here, if you want to be in the middle of the bust area then this is not for you but if you want to be within a 15 minute subway ride of the main areas head for this hotel.
Nov 3 2007 	Perfect again..	After making the huge mistake staying one night at Tribeca Grand, we managed to book a King Deluxe room on the 11th floor and enjoy the rest of the week at this lovely hotel. It's our second visit to 60 Thompson and after trying out few hotels in NYC, this has become a favorite. Friendly and helpful staff; service top notch; great rooms and bathrooms (yes you can hear the toilet flush from you neighbor and it can be a little annoying but itï¿½s reasonable); chic bar; one of NYC best restaurants; outdoor service; rooftop bar; GREAT location ï¿½ so all in all a perfect place to stay and enjoy NYC! No reason to look any further!
Oct 18 2007 	Love love love 60 Thompson!	My business partner and I stayed at 60 Thompson for 5 nights and we are really impressed by the service, the architecture, the food, the beds...there's absolutely nothing to fault this hotel -although it took me a while to find the hair dryer;-)
Sep 20 2007 	Nice Hotel but Check Your Credit Card	Hip, comfortable hotel with friendly, well-trained staff. Rooms are small but well-appointed. Free wireless was nice, but there was no desk to work at, so my laptop truly had to be a laptop. A little hard for the business traveler. The roof bar, reserved for guests and their guests, was a great place to hang out. Location is great for Soho, Tribeca, downtown shopping, eating, and hanging out. The only thing that marred my stay was a $54 charge to my credit card I received a week later in the mail for a &quot;minibar&quot; charge. Since I did not use the minibar at all, I called the reception and the staff person removed the charge (supposedly - I'm waiting for confirmation that my credit card was credited). She did not apologize or say that it may have been their mistake, leaving me with the feeling that she thought I was being dishonest. It's too bad because a simple apology for the misunderstanding would have given them a loyal guest who travels to NYC often. The whole thing leaves me with a bad feeling about the hotel, which is disappointing since the stay itself was quite nice. Check your credit card after you stay there!!
Sep 15 2007 	A cool and ultra trendy place to stay	I stay here regularly on business. I have to say that I always have an excellent experience. The staff have always been extremely helpful and friendly, nothing seems to be too much trouble. The restaurant is fantastic and the food is delicious. Room service is always prompt and on time and the roof top bar is a cool place to entertain with fantastic views of Manhattan. I find the rooms more spacious than others I have stayed in and the beds are one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in! Overall it's probably one of the best hotels I stay in and I am extremely fussy when it comes to accommodation!
Sep 14 2007	great location - terrific restaurant	I would go back,. We just returned from a four night stay. We had two rooms; a deluxe King and a deluxe double. It is a little overpriced when you consider the size of the rooms but you are paying for the location which is unbeatable. We liked the staff, particularly Michael, and thought the concierge staff was terrific.They were friendly and very helpful. The restaurant, Kittichai, is excellent. For breakfast I would recommend Balthazar at the corner of Crosby and Spring.It is an excellent break from the stuffier uptown hotels.Just make sure you bring your laptop. The only internet access the hotel has is at the front desk and it is slowwww.
Sep 6 2007 	Nasty staff and noisy	I stayed at the 60 Thompson for 2 nights. I asked for a quiet room when I got to the front desk as there was a great deal of music noise in the lobby bar. They selected a room and I stayed only a few minutes and went to dinner. I returned to find the music blaring and the room moving with the music. I called to the front desk and asked for another room. There were none, so they told me they could send up EAR PLUGS. They had put me in a room right over the DJ and speakers. They moved me the next day reluctantly and never apologized. No one apologized and I think the woman at the front desk thought it was probably funny as I heard her giggling when I left. I left a note for management and never heard from them.
Sep 4 2007	The Truth about the 60 Thompson	Plus:1. Great Location just steps from restaurants and shopping2. Beautiful rooftop bar with spectacular views3. Great restaurant in the hotel4. Showers are big and modern5. Beds are very very compfortableMinus:1. Rooftop bar staff all have attitudes and rarely smile (no joke)2. There is a two inch gap between your room door and the floor so late afternoon/early evening you can hear all types of noise in the hallways. To the hotels credit they keep the housekeeping staff pretty quiet during the morning hours so its not too bad.3. Concierge doesn't have a clue. Recommends places that were &quot;in&quot; about 3 years ago. If you want to get advice on new and fun places to hit just go up to the roof and talk to the locals (many of them have access to the bar with no membership but who cares). 4. The hotel is starting to look warn out.This is a cool place and I would stay again (but only in the mid to upper $200s/night.......
Aug 21 2007 	Great neighborhood	My partner and I had a early morning flight into NY, so when we got to the hotel, our room was definitely not ready. We didn't think it would be, as it was pretty early. The front desk was very courteous and said that they would hold our luggage and would call us on our cells as soon as it was ready. Luckily, the hotel is in a fantastic neighborhood with lots to see- lots of restaurants/ cafes &amp; a ton of hip boutiques. The hotel itself is very stylish. There was a fashion shoot going on in the lobby our first morning. The shower was a bit weird- the way it was designed allowed for water to get on the floor, but I guess that's what towels are for...-Our room didn't have a tub unfortunately- but when in NY who has time for a bath, I guess. The restaurant was nice- very swanky. The waiter accomodated to our dietary requests nicely. We ate early , so it was not packed, but it is definitely a place to see and be seen. The other people sitting near us were having some sort of fashion industry meeting- which kept us amused. The only bad thing I could say about the hotel is the sound carrying problem that someone already mentioned. We definitely heard people flushing their toilets/ and water thru the pipes which was a bit odd considering you are in such swanky surroundings. Also- the doors slam if not shut properly, so you constantly hear housekeeping and other guests slamming doors in the morning. You get over it pretty quickly though considering it's NY and you can't escape noise. Again- great neighborhood. Lots of things to do during the day-- and plenty of bars/ late night cafes near the hotel!
Aug 16 2007 	Superb	This was the final hotel we stayed in on our 'round the world trip' and was an excellent end to our travels. The rooms are fantastic and we felt thoroughly spoilt by thehotel surroundings and great staff. Having travelled to many other hotels around the globe I think we can safely say that this was our favourite hotel and we we'd love to stay here again if we visit New York again in the future.
Aug 6 2007	Great location good service average rooms	We stayed at 60 Thompson from a Thursday to a Sunday. We had an early flight &amp; arrived at 10am. Our room happened to be ready which was a bonus. The room itself was average, small and slightly worn looking. There were traces of the last guests - a letter left on the dresser, water in the ice bucket, but the bed appeared to have been changed &amp; overall the room was very clean. If you are planning to use the room for business, there is no desk. Our only major problem was the noise on the Saturday night. Not the hotel's fault - we happened to be next to a very rowdy room who was smashing doors &amp; yelling most of the night. As with most boutique hotels the sound proofing just isn't there &amp; even during the other days &amp; nights we could clearly hear flushing toilets in other rooms, speaking &amp; closing of doors. The hotel is in a great location and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Would we stay again? For that price we will probably look for another hotel close by.
Aug 5 2007	Still a top choice	60 used to be my favorite five years ago ans I had not been back since. I was happily surprised by the addition of a great downstairs thai fusion restaurant and also by the ever happening friday night drinks on the roof top.Rooms ok though at bit small to my standards. Staff is helpful but sometimes a bit posh for NY. The concierge is very good to get you in the fashionnable spots.I also found a great guide book the &quot;luxe guide&quot; in that hoteL
Jul 10 2007 	towels frayed n soiled and that was supposed to be clean	my husband n i planned a wonderful 5days stay in nyc over july 4th week and decided to stay at 60 thompson hotel in the heart of soho in nyc,since reading reviews about it here n other sites...great location n fun..well we booked directly with hotels website for a superior king room..upon checking in they first gave us a room small enough like the size of a dorm room in college.. with a bed that was a queen maybe? were still not sure..,we kept bumping into each other....we complained n said we booked for a king but they kept on insisting that was a king..well i don't know who does the measuring but it aint a king,at their website the room stated that it is 325sq in size more like 150sq..so small its like my walk in closets at home...well that same evening we decided that this is not working out with this hotel n they were not accommadating us...so we just booked with expedia that evening at our fav hotel in nyc uptown with larger nicer rooms n amazing location...definetly can't recommend 60 thompson to anyone..terrible hotel,towels that were so frayed n soiled i was afraid it will fall apart,terrible customer service, super tiny rooms n very pricy....but great location..in the heart of soho..gave it two stars cause of the location n location only...
Jun 9 2007 	Perfect Soho location.	Perfect location, nice design, excellent breakfast, enjoyable small convenient rooms but smell of cigarette in a no smoking room, well set bathroom, good value for NYC, good restaurant (you have to pay a 20% service charge if you are staying at the hotel and not worth the 20%), bar always closed for private parties, staff at reception almost nice, good concierge, slow elevators because of the keys you need to use it.Definitely the best choice in the area.
May 28 2007 	Fantastic location - loved it	My husband and I stayed here as the first leg of our honeymoon.I'd stayed here before on business (i.,e I wasn't paying) so it was a bit of a splurge as we normally stay at cheaper hotels in NYC (Washington Square Hotel).I booked through Quikbook and got it for almost half the advertised rack rate. The King deluxe room is advertised on the hotel's website for around $650. We're Brits and are a little intimidated by all the tipping that goes in the the USA but it was pretty painless here. The bellboy greeted our car (tip) and another brought the bags up to the room (tip).The room was lovely, very stylish, not huge but hey, it's New York. It had a sofa, mini bar, treats, marble bathroom, robes, safe, big bed with lovely soft pillows. All the comforts. The hotel was very quiet and you never really see anyone else around.A lot of stars stay here, we got our picture taken one evening leaving as the paparazzi were waiting for Kirsten Dunst who was staying there at the time. There were fashion shoots happening in the (small) lobby and guest list queues waiting to go into the bar. Talking about the bar, the roof-top wasn't open (May) and the Thom bar on the first floor was pretty expensive and full of non-guests and wanabes. I think there's better bars in walking distance to be honest so wouldn't hang out here.Great location if you like being in the heart of Soho and Tribeca, we walked to Bubbys Diner for breakfast and a great restaurant called Jane on West Houston for dinner. I asked the concierge to make a dinner reservation one night and they are great - a card was put in my room stating the reservation and directions on how to get there. We went to Public in the lower East Side and the food was lovely.The turn-down service is cute, bottle of water and a brownie.If you can get it for a good deal, stay there. Much better than staying uptown if you like neighbourhood restaurants and cool shopping.
May 24 2007 	Great but showing some wear.....	My wife and I have stayed at 60 Thompson two other times over the last four years. Each time we stayed for about a week. It had been about a year and a half since our last visit and we took advantage of a &quot;good deal&quot; on the basic queen room at $299. Well $299 doesn't get you much at all in NYC so we were thrilled to find a good deal. And, at 60 Thompson you do get a lot - attentive bellmen, cool staff, rooms where everything works, great showers and a nice bathroom. The Soho location can't be beat.In the past we always upgraded to a larger queen room. It wasn't available for this visit and we sure missed it! It has more room, an extra chair and a view to the front. The standard queen (which is smaller) only has a rear building view and you get some noise from air vents from the building behind the hotel. Our room was neat and clean but there were signs of wear. The couch had a stain and some of the towels seem to be a bit old. (They aren't the same brand they used to have. I used to think 60 Thompson had the thickest towels in NYC!) We also needed to call down for new shampoo and conditioner three out of seven days. The lobby area is very worn looking, with faded fabric pillows and carpeting. I ordered a glass of wine on the rooftop lounge and the reusable plastic glass had a huge crack!Staying there for a week we had a lot of reasons to interact with the staff. They were always attentive and friendly. The bellmen were especially nice and greeted us each day. Any requests we had with the front desk were addressed very quickly. Everyone seems &quot;on the ball&quot;.It's a pretty cool place and a great location. But it isn't plush. If you can get the premium queen and a room pretty high up I think you will enjoy it a lot. My stay 8 months ago at the Soffitel, the #2 ranked hotel on Tripadvisor in NYC, wasn't as good as 60 Thompson. In NYC I am always grateful for a room under $400 with a good staff, a clean room and air conditioning and plumbing that work. When you add its location it is hard to beat. Now, if they could just bring back those uber thick towels and refurbish the lobby........
Mar 20 2007	great location great restaurant mediocre hotel	60 thompson is a trendy hotel in a superb location and a fantastic restaurant. However, the rooms are extremely small for the prices they charge. Also, they are now in need of renovation as the furniture is old and shabby. The worst part of the hotel is the 3rd floor which is directly above the bar area and the noise can be heard in the room until 2 am. If you must stay at this hotel - avoid the 3rd floor at all costs as you will not get any sleep. Unfortunately, noone warns you of this problem when you book the room but it should be known that the 3rd floor cannot be used as a hotel floor. Great restaurant though and the location in Soho is close to everything.
Feb 20 2007 	A so so Hotel in Soho New York.	I am just back from a 4 night stay in New York with my husband and 6 friends. We were there to celebrate our friends 40th birthday. We choseThe 60 Thompson for its reputatuion as a boutique hotel. We knew it was expensive before going and naturally expected the service to match the price --it didn't. The place and staff are trying so hard to be trendy that it is clear good customer care and service is not a job requirement. The rooms probably very smart when first open are now a touch dull/shabby.and small.The bar is a very popular night spot for local trendies and celebs.it is a happening place but unfortunately hotel guests are not priority and in fact when we were there private parties meant we couldn't get into the bar and were actually asked to move from our seats.The best thing about the hotel was its location but I don't think that is enough to encourage me to go back to it.
Feb 5 2007	Great time at the Thompson	Booked an excellent rate at the 60 Thompson through the Quikbook website for 7 days and had a fantastic time.Location: excellent location really in the heart of Soho. Possibly the Mercer hotel is better located but also far more expensive.Vibe: the Vibe of the hotel is quite young, with loud music etc. On friday and saturday evenings the hotel lobby turns into a bar, joining with its actual bar &quot;thom bar&quot;. We liked this aspect of the hotel but you should eb aware of it.Service: as we met friends at the hotel who were travelling to new york from europe, we made all of our luch and dinner reservations through the concierge about a month before we were due to arrive. The Concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about new york, and added greatly to our wonderful experience of the big apple.Having said that, you get the feeling that the large number of VERY young staff means that there is a bit more gloss than actual hotel experience going on here.Rooms: stayed in a superior king room which was nicely appointed but could have been a tad larger considering its category.Bathroom: our room had a shower in teh bathtub and our friends had a shower only which may have been preferable.Nice Touches: Bottle of Voss water each evening along with a fudge cake was a nice touch.Hotel restaurant Kittichai has good asian food and is definately worth trying one evening.
Jan 30 2007	Boutique done right!	My wife and I where staying in the city for a family function and just came back from a 3 night stay at the hotel. Unlike a lot of boutique hotels in the city the vibe of the 60 Thompson was different. The lobby didn't feel like a nightclub that Phillipe Starck designed as most do. The staff was very attentive to servicing the customer instead of trying to grab a modeling or acting job and amenities felt well placed and relevant. The rooms albeit small (as most rooms in NYC are) where well appointed with fantastic toiletries, min-bar delights and electronics. The night housekeeping staff was even so kind to clean our room, turn down the bed, and replace all of the old towels while we where out to dinner in the city. (We haphazardly left the do not disturb sign on the door). I will definetely stay when I get back as I finally found a hotel in the cty that I would like to frequent vs. searching for that next place.
Jan 28 2007 	Great location beautiful restaurant awful service and organization	We booked our weekend stay at the 60 Thompson and requested a non-smoking room. Upon arriving at the hotel, I noticed that my room had an ashtray and I called down to the front desk to request for a non-smoking room. They said that nothing on the reservation stated that we had in fact requested non-smoking, and would only be able to switch us to a non-smoking room the following day. (Our confirm clearly said &quot;non-smoking&quot;). The hotel claims that when the hotel room is booked via outside reservation agents, the request for non-smoking is not given to them. After insisting multiple times that it was important to us, and going down to the lobby with our confirmation as proof, we finally got an upgrade for the night to a beautiful, large suite. Some complaints about the suite: the wireless Internet didn't work, the TV in the bedroom refused to change channels, and the toilets were so noisy they would have scared small children. Upon checking out, we found on our bill a $10 charge for the Ethernet cable they had provided us when the Wi Fi failed. (We complained and didn't end up having to pay for it). Also upon checkout, we were shocked to find a $220 charge for the minibar, even though we hadn't used anything. Word of warning: I had noticed in both rooms we stayed in (the suite and the regular room the next day) that the minibar did not have full inventory to begin with -- this was probably the source of the discrepancy. Make sure the list provided in the minibar in fact matches the inventory, because some of the items --- &quot;Intimacy Kit&quot; ($110++), and Tocca Candle ($50) can run steep.Disappointingly for such an expensive and &quot;upscale&quot; hotel, the gym was located in the musty, dark basement level and was a whopping 15x15' room. It included 2 treadmills, one bicycle and one step machine, which, when we were working out, were all occupied. Ventilation is minimal and there are no windows in the room. When I returned home, I realized that I had left my phone charger in the hotel room. When I called to file a search request, the front desk told me to call back the next day when housekeeping arrived. No reassurance, remorse, or any sign of standard procedure here regarding lost items --- while this is acceptable behavior for a $100/night hotel, in my mind it is not for a $400+/night hotel. Overall the staff seemed to be hired for their looks, not their commitment to quality service. On the bright side, the restaurant Kittichai is stunning and the food delicious. The room service menu is abundant with Kittichai selections, which is a delight. The suite we had was gorgeous despite the technical difficulties we had. The wonderful SoHo location may make this hotel a worthwhile stay, although if you're looking for seamless 5-star hotel service that usually comes with this kind of price tag, don't count on 60 Thompson to deliver.
Jan 9 2007 	Perfect location	We stayed at 60 Thompson for a short week last summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. Having never stayed at the hotel before, we picked it based on a friends suggestions and its location as we knew we were spending most of our time in the area.The location is one of the best considering the low number of hotels around Soho. the hotel itself was nice - stylish and modern. Staff was helpful, the room was cozy but not very big. I knew this beforehand so it wasn't a shock or anything. The view on a higher floor was amazing and sounds from the street were surprisingly quiet, don't know how they'd be on a lower level?My only complaint is what others have mentioned, plumping is oddly loud, I could hear rather clearly when someone flushed a toilet in the room above. also the room door was very poorly sealed (annoyingly common in hotels) so sound from the hallway was pretty loud. luckily there wasn't a lot of movement there.Overall it was a very pleasant stay, unfortunately we didn't have time to check the restaurant for other than breakfast which was good though, and the decor there was really cool.
Jan 3 2007 	Beautiful hotel killer restaurant dazed service	IF you can get a good rate here, 60 is your best boutique bet in NYC. Even the tiny rooms are on the stylish relatively comfy side, but I've been upgraded a few times, and the suites are great. Lobby is cool and fun- bar's a good scene (rooftop especially) - restaurant Kittichai is one of my favorite rooms anywhere and totally delicious. You cannot beat the location- just off of bustling West Broadway, so you don't step out into the madding SoHo crowds, but close to everything. I can't say that service really exists here, but they're not nasty or snotty, just kind of dizzy and uninterested.
Dec 13 2006 	A Perfect hotel Stay at the 60 Thompson	My girlfiriend and I just got back from New York. The 60 Thompson was a great Hotel. The Neighborhood is a perfect getaway in the city of New York. The quiet street is also a plus. The room was small , however I am told that all New York Hotel rooms are small. The Room we got had no view which was a bummer, but it was very quiet. The staff was pretty friendly even in the hip bar/lounge on a Saturday night. The outside patio was closed for the winter(bummer). The Flatscreen TV was great, bed was comfy and cozy. All in all it was great Stay. I will be back.
Dec 5 2006 	Freezing rooms	This property has a serious heating problem. The room was so cold despite repeated compliants I eventually contracted a cold. Decor was bland, staff were unhelpful and the business centre consists of a laptop sitting on the front desk. We had a much better and much hipper experience at Gramercy Park Hotel which scores poorer on Tripadvisor. Will not be visiting 60 Thompson if Gramecy or any other hip hotel for that matter has room. One very disappointed customer.
Nov 28 2006	Great location	Meant to write this earlier. My stay at the 60 Thompson was for 3 nights early October. Checked in early so I had a room with no view. I agree with another review that said the plumbing was very noisy. It was heard throughout the night when people got in bed late. The gym was small and cramped with a few machines and you stare at mirrors or the small tv screes. There are no disinfectant sprays but a water cooler is availaber. The bar was great, delicious cocktails. Very mixed crowd on a Sunday night. Most of the time the concierge was not there so the front desk took all the calls. I borrowed a international transformer from them, but it took them a long time to find someone available to bring it upstairs. Other than that, it can be difficult to find a taxi during dinner hours with all the shoppers finishing their trip in Soho.
Nov 21 2006 	Great room Soholocation but staff needs work	checked in to a clueless front desk that didn't know how to even work the computer. They managed to work it out and got me to my room after a little confusion. The room was actually great, I was a little concerned after reading reviews but it was a nice size and comfortable. It had a big flat screen tv and small couch in the corner. I was there for work and wished it had a better work area but the small table and chair did the trick. I called down to order room service and was told to call back later...? I did call back and ordered, food was great and there in 20 min. Like I said the hotel is good but the service is strange.The Soho area is great for high end shopping but pretty quite during the day. I found a great coffee place just up the street and their is Pizza on the corner. The door men were not very helpfull with bags unless you were a 6 ft blond but they did give some good advice on where to eat etc. The conciere is a joke and not much help.On check out the had the wrong rate and it took them 20 min to figure out how to make a change. They were confused again but I was not surprised. as an extra note note my housekeeper each day was a fantastic romainian woman who said good morning every day, folded anything I left out and volenteered to take my shoes to get them shined. I would have hired her to take care of my house.
Nov 17 2006 	Eh It was just ok	My boyfriend and I stayed there this past weekend. We arrived at the hotel a little early and was told the room wasnï¿½t ready and to come back. We were ok with this; after all, we were early. So we did. We came back 30 minutes after the check in time and were told it still was not ready. They suggested we go to the restaurant and have something to eat. So we did- only to be told at the restaurant that they werenï¿½t serving lunch anymore (Shouldnï¿½t the person at the desk know that?). So we went and sat in the lobby. We thought it was odd that the staff was totally unmoved by the fact that our room wasnï¿½t ready. They just acted like it was totally normal. Our room was finally ready 45 minutes after the stated time, and we found it to be lackluster at best. The &quot;Superior Room King bedroom&quot; was very small- probably the smallest hotel room I've had. There was room for the bed and not much more. The room was also stuffy and hot. The windows in our room did not open, and the air conditioner did not work either. It was unseasonably warm during our stay and it would have been lovely to have had the option of not sweating in the room. The staff was not really interested in helping us- they really couldnï¿½t have cared less about us. When the time came for us to leave, I called the front desk and asked for our car, which was parked in their valet lot (the only option for parking). About 15 minutes later we checked out. I went to the desk to pay the bill, while my boyfriend went to wait for the car. There was no store in the hotel, but there was a number of deli's around (it is, after all, new york). We had purchased a few bottles of water and juice for our room in order to avoid paying thru the nose for juice/water that had probably been in the mini bar for 6 months. However, at checkout, I had to defend myself- they were insistent that we took something from the mini bar- but she was unable to tell me what that was. I just checked my charge card- and have a mystery charge on there from the hotel for $6.50. I'm sure I'll spend that and more in long distance fighting this petty charge. Very frustrating.What was even more frustrating, however, was waiting an additional 45 minutes for the car. Despite calling and despite there being no one else waiting for a car- my boyfriend had to go back inside and ask again about the car. So- for some reason itï¿½s at least an hour's wait for our car, which has me wondering where on earth did our car spend the night? Newark? Itï¿½s a mediocre hotel at best, but the problems we encountered and their indifferent staff had will likely prevent us from staying there again. They just didnï¿½t seem to have it together.
Nov 10 2006 	Bit of a disaster/Got better	Arrived to find the room with a bath and desk we'd booked wasn't available, but were told we'd get it next day (we were staying for a week). So we take the smaller room. Next day we're told we can change mid afternoon. Mid afternoon comes and goes. I drop down to find out what's happening. I tell a woman at the desk who tells another woman, who goes 'whatever.' Now, she doesn't know I'm there, but still... An hour later I'm shown to a room that's smaller than the one we've just left, smells damp, has a wet floor and joins to another room. Someone's playng rap next door.I don't even bother to unpack.When my partner returns (she's out and made the booking in her name), she drops down to talk to the desk. She gets a guy, he gets us a new room. Everything is fine, except 'whatever' doesn't even look at us for the rest of the week.The new lobby bar looks good, though. Less of a scene going on...
Nov 10 2006 	Too cool for school in Soho	60 Thompson is a lovely hotel. The sumptious yet minimalist decor was fab, the room really large for NY and very comfortable, with a huge bathroom filled with great goodies (all made by Fresh, a very indulgent range that I subsequently purchased to remind me of my stay!).The Thom Bar is my favourite bar in the city, it is dark, moody, achingly trendy and totally decadent (and of course the prices reflect that), but it really gave us the flavour of being in the thick of the world's hippest city - fabulous!!There are two downsides for me - the bathroom plumbing is horrendous and it sounded like someone banging a crow bar against our cystern, the other is purely personal. When I visit NY, a big part of my experience is to be woken by taxi horns and to fall out of your hotel in the morning and be surrounded by skyscrapers, none of which you will find at 60 Thompson. This, however, may be the very reason someone else may book this hotel as it's in the heart of one of NY's funkiest areas but is very quiet, especially at the weekend.All in all though, would I stay again? You bet your life I would!!
Sep 29 2006 	Go glam in NY	I have just returned from NY where I stayed at 60 Thompson for 3 nights. What a fab place and I really did feel at home. The hotel is in a perfect location - lots of cool shops and restos. The rooms are cosy and I felt at home - loved the cheeky brownie on your pillow at night - nice touch!. Most of the staff were friendly. Access to the roof top bar is a bonus - we swigged champagne and admired the views as well as the cute bar mangager. All in all a good stay - I will be back soon.
Sep 9 2006 	Soggy night	We needed a place for a one night stay in the Soho area. The hotel looks nice and our room was nice; however, when we returned from the reception, my backpack which was on the floor in a corner, was soaked through (luckily there wasn't much in it) - there was a leak under the carpet in the corner of the room and the carpet was all wet. We called the management and they apologized, but couldn't move us to another room and didn't offer any sort of compensation for the problem. I expected better for the proce tag of this hotel.
Sep 5 2006	A Rare Luxury in NYC	I just returned from my second stay at 60 Thom, and it was just as enjoyable the second time. When I arrived, I was extremely surprised and impressed to find that Michael, the doorman, remembered me from my last visit, some 8 months prior. With a big smile and warm welcome, he and his colleague Jordan, took care of my car and bags and made me feel right at home. I have been to many other boutique hotels in NY, and more often than not, they seem to think that a snooty, aloof staff is somehow a mark of their exclusivity. Not at 60 Thom, where the staff are genuinely friendly and warm and helpful and welcoming, a rare luxury in NYC. The room was very nice, understated in it's modern design... not trying too hard. Little touches like heavy crystal drinking glasses, a beautiful large flat-screen tv, beautiful leather wall tiles, and ultra-comfortable beds make the room warm and inviting. An iron in the room would have been nice, however. The roofdeck is also a great amenity; hip scene with lots of sexy international types. All in all, I would definitely return to 60 Thom ... in fact, I promised Michael that I would. Now, I just have to hope that I can find a good rate on Quikbook when I return, because the regular rates are a bit pricey.
Sep 5 2006 	Will never go back	My husband and I stayed for two nights in this hotel and we were very dissapointed. We had booked the room a month in advance and requested a non smoking room, and what did we get, a smoking room.....just great. The room was stinking, my husband called the reception to change the room and of course they were full.....the standard answer. He then asked to speak to the manager on duty who implied that we had made the mistake and did not request non smoking and that she could not help us in any way. The room was $450 a night, this must pay for the trendy uniforms the staff were wearing....surely not for the managers salary. After a heated converstion miracously they found another room....what's the chances eh. Why could they not have just done that in the first place. We had dinner there as it was now 10.30pm and after dinner we went to the bar. We were met at the bar door by another ex model who asked if we had requested a seat in the bar? We had no idea such a thing was needed, we informed her that we were residents but hey, ho......not good enough. There was a large table empty and when we pointed this out we were informed that it was kept vacant incase a &quot;VIP&quot; should arrive, not for the likes of us.I love good looking hotels and good looking people but this hotel was just too shallow for me. Will never return to 60 Thompson.
Aug 25 2006 	Great but not fantastic!	Just returned from a three night stay in a King Suite at 60 Thompson (booked on Quikbook). We were at first slightly surprised to be checking in at the front desk which seemed to be in the middle of the bar area and very loud. But we had a room on 6th floor which was quiet (relative to NY) despite being across from the elevator and facing the street. King Suite was not much of a suite as it only accommodated a small sitting area just adequate for a sofa and table in addition to the bedroom. However we loved the balcony which was the length of the living room and bedroom, we never used the A/C as we could open balcony door in both rooms. Bathroom was very disappointing for a hotel of this standard (no storage place, music or TV in the bathroom). Very little storage place in the room for clothes. Overall the room was finished to a low standard with IKEA quality furniture. The hotel personnel was very friendly at all times and the concierge was helpful at printing from the web once he was not familiar with the location himself. We visited the rooftop lounge twice, which had a nice view but terrible service. Location is fantastic! I would not mind staying at 60 Thompson again, however given the shortcomings listed above and that this is not the only boutique hotel in NY I will try to stay at a different hotel next time.
Jul 24 2006 	Not bad- but sparse for the price	I recently spent a weekend at 60 Thompson. When I lived in NY, I spent alot of time at the bar there, so I knew what to expect as far as a the vibe, and the location. The hotel definitely does not disappoint in that regard. The problem I had was with the room itself. I booked a king suite, and even with a significant discount from Quikbook, the room was still very expensive, in addition to being quite small. I typically stay uptown, and for only a little more, you can stay in a suite at the Peninsula, with far superior space, service and amenities. Overall, 60 Thompson was fun, but not worth the price. Plus, they really need to renovate the rooms.
Jul 18 2006	Wonderful...Perfect Location	This was me and my husband's first time visiting New York. We were unsure of where to stay. We just knew we wanted to be close to restaurants and shopping. EVERYONE walks in New York. So put your walking shoes on. When we arrived at 60 Thompson I was extremely impressed. This boutique hotel is super sheek and elegant. The service was magnificent. The location is PERFECT. Its close to everything. When you a walk out of the hotel there are boutiques everywhere and a ton of eating places. The hotel is only a couple of blocks away from Broadway where a lot of the major clothing and shoe stores are located. We could not have a picked a more perfect hotel. There is also a roof top bar that is ultra hip and has a beautiful view of the city. When we return to New York we will certainly stay here again. Also the rooms are pretty pricey but we got a good deal by booking it on Quickbook. It cut the price of the room in half.
Jul 16 2006	Glamorous boutique hotel great service top location	You can spend a lot of money on a hotel that cliams to be an unber cool boutique hotel in downtown manhattan and be very disappointed. Whilst 60 Thompson is not cheap, you do get good value. We booked ahead of time and got a deal on a room that was much bigger than the normal shoe box you get in major cities. The decor is very cool and up to the minute. Big bathroom with delicious products. Great food from room service. Impeccable service from the staff. The big selling point in the summer is the stunning roof terrace bar which is very comfortable, intimate and has amazing views of the manhattan skyline. The hotel is in a fantatstic location a couple of blocks from broadway in the heart of the lively SoHo district.
Jul 11 2006	Great Location Disappointed with Service	My wife and I booked a room at 60 Thompson to celebrate our one year anniversary. I must first say that we were looking for a place in the heart of the village, and it will be tough to beat the location and atmosphere of 60 Thompson. My main grievance comes with the staff. We had booked a King Deluxe smoking room for the night. We checked in, (they did mention Happy Anniversary) and were shown to our room. The hardwood floors and bathroom were great. We right away noticed it was not a smoking room so I called the front desk to confirm. They relayed to us that in fact it was not a smoking room, but they would send someone up right away with keys to our new room. When we entered the new room, I was shocked. No hard wood floors, tiny bathroom, tiny room. I asked if it was in fact a King Deluxe room and they said they had none of those available in smoking. I was a little disappointed, what happened to the room I had booked, did they give it away? I was told we were moved to a lower level room due to availability. I then mentioned that there must be a rate differance since it was a lower level room, and I was given no cooperation on this and my request for an explanation was denied as they danced around the reason. I had in my hand proof of a guarenteed King Deluxe Smoking room. I ended up paying that rate for a Queen Superior room. Most days I would have let it slide, but on my anniversary, I was dissapointed.As stated before, the location is wonderful and right smack in the middle of the village, close to everything. I have stayed in many hotels in NYC and this was very disappointing in terms of service. Next time I will stay in the Mercer or SoHo Grand. I have stayed in both before, and regret trying out 60 Thompson on such a special night. You may enjoy the roof top bar, it was nice for a drink or tow, bu the heartbeat of the village is down on the street, not in the &quot;members and gusest only&quot; rooftop bar. You may find you check in on a day where the staff is on top of their game, but at those prices, they should be on top of their game everytime, every guest, especially those celebrating special occasions. You will be guarenteed service each and every time at the other two village hotels mentioned above.
Jul 10 2006	Fantastic location restaurant.	Very luxurious, primely located hotel plum in the middle of Soho - great restaurants abound (including the one on site!) and even better shopping! Very pricey, but worth it for a splurge on a night or two - cramped rooms as is typical of that area - but modernly decorated and the service is fantastic - I pinched a nerve in my back an hour before I was due to leave the hotel and the city and the concierge made a plan faster than lightning, booked me into a nearby spa for emergency massage and called a taxi for me. Really was impressed - and if it wasnt for her, I'd have had a nightmarish 20 hour flight home! Very cool place, day of arrival Vogue was executing a fashion shoot in the foyer - you know you're in new york :)
Jul 9 2006	Diamond in Soho	60 Thompson is a great hotel. The rooms, while small (most hotel rooms in NYC are small anyway), are well appointed and comfortable. Each room has a nice flat panel television, a comfotable bed, and an excellent bathroom. My only complaint is that rooms are given out based upon when you checked in (unless you reserve a suite); therefore, you could feasibly get stuck in a smoking room...but it is not that bad.One of the best features of this hotel is its bars. The rooftop bar is absolutely fabulous!! Unbelievable views and great drinks. As they say...it is &quot;the place to see and be seen.&quot; Try their mixed berry Mohito.Another benefit of this hotel is that it is centrally located in Soho. Bars and restaurants are at your fingertips.The staff is very friendly. They helped me out with a variety of issues.I would definately stay at this hotel again. I had a wonderful stay.
Jul 4 2006	...thumbs up across the board.	We live in NJ and stay in the city from time-to-time to get some time away from the kids. We usually stay at a different place each time, Soho Grand, Righa Royale. This was the first time at 60 Thompson. We paid $299/nt for a King Deluxe (room #83)... Room was of a decent size (for NYC &quot;boutique) with enough room for a sofa with coffee table, lounge chair and work desk... Great bathroom (though no bath tub). Good size and very clean. Overall, everything was super clean and well kept...Staff was great. Professional, courteous, yet approachable and &quot;real&quot;. Not pulling a muscle to push that 'elite' vibe...Location is perfect. In the middle of SOHO on a quiet block...Both the restaurant (Kittichai) and 2nd floor bar were top notch. Restaurant was actually very reasonably priced, can't say the same for the bar, but both delivered great experiences...Overall, we will stay there each time we go to the city. I was just very comfortable with every aspect of the stay. Unlike lots of boutique hotels nowadays that deliver an inconsistent experience, 60 Thompson pulled it off...
Jun 14 2006	cool hotel great service	Stayed for a long weekend in a deluxe king size room and thoroughly enjoyed everything about it. We arrived early and found we could check in without delay. Our room was of a good size for New York and the only small criticism was a couple of cigarette burns on the carpet. However, everything else was of a high standard with a smart bathroom and the bed was extremely comfortable.We had reserved a table in the hotel restaurant for our first night and this was confirmed to us on check in. The meal itself was excellent as was the service. In fact we found the service to be second to none throughout our stay from all of the staff and could not fault this at all. At night we came back to the room to find the bed turned down and a plate of miniature pastries and brownies, together with bottled water and ice, left for us.The two bars in the hotel, the Thom Bar and Rooftop, were both great and we spent most time in the Thom Bar which was always busy with a cool vibe. My wife also took a particular liking to the Lychee martinis which are something of a speciality here.All in all we had a great stay and would definitely return.
May 30 2006	Super Cool 60 Thompson	My fiance and I stayed 2 nights in the 60 Thompson in the last week in May 2006 and it is definitely the place to be.We stayed in a deluxe double which was comfortable and clean with a massive flat screen TV, fully stocked mini bar and some lovely toiletries in the bathroom.The hotel has a guests only, roof top bar which has some fantastic views over the Manhattan skyline. You can clearly see the Empire State building and watching the sunset from here is truly idyllic. The hotel is slap bang in the middle of Soho which is teeming with trendy bars, resturants and boutique shops. It is also within walking distance of the Spring Street subway and Broadway and the shopping is great so have your credit card handy!This hotel, however, will always have a special place in my heart as my boyfriend chose the hotel's roof top bar to propose to me. The hotel staff, who were in on the secret, were great. They brought champagne and generally treated us like royalty. We finished our evening in a small resturant across the street from the hotel called the Country Cafe. The lady who ran the place was lovely and when she heard our news, she promptly brought more champagne!The concierge service downstairs was invaluable as after a hard days shopping, you can forget wading through the guide book for a nice place to eat. They can recommend some great local places and fill you in what's happening locally. They also helped us out with transport back to the airport.The hotel also has its own resturant but we did not eat here. It also has a bar called Thom which is open to the public and is supposed to be very highly rated (we didn't actually go as we spent our evenings on the roof top.)No breakfast included in the price but there are delis a plenty in the local area and a great pizza place, Ben's Pizza, at the top of the street.A great place to stay.
Mar 28 2006	Fantastic hotel great location!	My husband and I just returned from a long weekend in New York and a fantastic stay at 60 Thompson, I can't rate it highly enough! The staff were great and very helpful, and our room was fantastic, and ready for us when we arrived on Thursday morning. We had dinner at Kittichai on our first night (try the chocolate ribs!) which was delicious. We had never been to NY before and the location of the hotel was so perfect, close to all the great shops and some fantastic restaurants. We can't wait to go back to 60 Thompson and are hoping to make it an annual event, we really wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!
Feb 22 2006	Funky cool if you have a few bucks to spend	I have to admit that I was a little turned off by the fact that we had to wait for our room to be ready (at 6pm at night), and being told that we were being given a free upgrade which turned out to be false. Add to that we had a room that smelled like smoke all night long (it was a non-smoking room but must have been beside a smoking room), and I probably wouldn't go back to this hotel for it's price (nearly $400 Canadian with taxes).All the bad out of the way now, I have to say this hotel has got it all if you don't mind the price. The rooms are incredible. We love the flat screen tv, comfy bed, and stylish bathroom. The lounge is so hot and trendy we felt like celebs having some pre-dinner appetizers and drinks. The food, by the way, is out of this world there too!! Breakfast in the restaurant was top notch. Can't complain about atmosphere, location (soho!), nor the food.
Jan 3 2006	great location but.....	Excellent concierge team.Rooms a little shabier this time round. A non- matching and badly marked chest of drawers seemed at odds with the design focus to which the welcome pack alluded. Maintaining the design focus is a challenge which needs continuing investment and it is not clear whether this is recognised.Returning to the room at 2pm and after 4pm to find the room unmade was disappointing. Reception seemed surprised I found this substandard. The only staff visit to the room was to check the minibar which seemed a misplaced service priority. Having a room prepared before dark does not seem an excessive requirement particularly when vacant since early morning.The fact that I have not received a reply to my note to the manager makes me question whether feedback is valued or whether it is perceived to be important to say that it is.At just under 500USD per night it could have been better. The reviewer who paid 200USD got the bargain.
Jan 2 2006	Overall Great Stay	Stayed 4 nights in mid December in what seemed to be pre-holiday peak season. Deluxe King ran 440-440 per night. WHAT I LIKED: Friendly seemingly genuine service. There is a hip attitude pervading the place, as evidenced with the photo shoot occurring in the bar upon our arrival, but we were almost always greeted with warm smiles and very friendly service. The one exception that comes to mind was the concierge desk; they seemed disorganized and hassled, and offered curt responses to requests. Just avoid them.I like smaller sized properties, and this was just perfect in that regard. I also liked the residential feel to the place; it was like staying at a hip friends pied a terre. Room was thoughtfully designed and reasonably sized. Good-sized well-designed marble bathroom with solid water pressure and temperature regulation. Bed was very comfortable, but wouldn't call it memorable. Sheets may be Frette, but really just standard hotel line with a few noticable repairs. Towels were pretty standard and not Frette. Twice a day service kept towels replenished and room in order, but they were slightly skimped on Fresh sugar toiletries.Didn't eat at the property...too many good options nearby. Of note is that Aquagrill is VERY near. And so are Kee's Chocolates!Fantastic location for shopping and exploring. SOHO is in many ways one big mall, which sounds kind of sad, but it's not that bad.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:Room was more skuffed up than I would have liked. Although room 88 was relatively quiet, imperfect seal of windows let it a bit of noise. Spot on chair and marks on furniture were too noticeable. Although visually appealing, some furnishing were of so-so quality, but certainly not as bad as W chain.Location not great for finding available taxis easily. Consider car service. Several Spring St subway stations are nearby, as is Dean and Deluca, which is great.All in all, I would stay here again at a better rate. Perhaps need to try Mercer for comparison.
Dec 23 2005	Best in Soho 1/3 the price of Mercer!	I was skeptical, but the staff, service and GREAT beds won me over. I paid $189 on a holiday special, and got upgraded on check-in to a Deluxe King. First of all, let me say that I am young and supposedly hip, that is to say I am Jason Pomeranc (that's Pomerantz)'s key demographic. That settled, Mr. Pomeranc's people know what they are doing. My stay at 60 Thompson kicked off what turned out to be the better part of a long weekend in New York during the transit strike. I stayed at two other hotels, my usual Westin Essex House and the Sheraton New York for the last (emergency) night. I had just spent a week in Canada, so I was a bit weary of hotel-hopping. From the moment I arrived at 60 Thom, I was treated like family. Check in was a breeze, and considering I had a ton of luggage from my week's travels to bring in, the bellman was as cool as could be. I only detected an air of snobbery on one of the bellmen who, thankfully, was pretending to be uninterested in another set of guests. I have a sinking feeling that during a certain time of year, they hire a number of people who can't help having a certain attitude that tends to put off some guests. Moving on...My room, #93 on the ninth floor, faced east toward Soho as all the Deluxe Kings do. The dark hardwood floors and stark furniture give the room a loft feel, especially when you open the windows and let the wind blow the curtains. My first gripe was practical: there isn't enough darn closet space! My closet must have been on a structural column or something because there wasn't one but two areas where it was about 4&quot; deep - barely enough room for a hanging suitcase and clothes and two hotel bathrobes. The king bed was great, just a massive white cloud ready for the magic to happen on its extremely comfortable mattress. The slick 42&quot; plasma screen TV came equipped with a DVD player and separate aiwa CD stereo, and they even gave me a cable to connect my laptop to the TV speakers, so I could play whatever music I wanted. This is something they wouldn't do at any of the other hotels I stayed at this trip. As for the rest...well...the &quot;couch&quot; made a nice luggage bench, and the big leather chair had no desk so it became a clothes hangar. Ah well, the bed made up for either. The bathroom, with its black-marble walls looked nice, but was just a basic shower...although the shampoo by 'fresh' was very good. All in all, the room was beautiful, but I would have added a sexy Aeron chair and a good working desk. I could definitely live full-time in one of these rooms. One evening, when I wanted to dine in my room but not pay room service over-prices, the front desk gladly gave me a laminated menu book of all local restaurants that deliver. In the case that a restaurant didn't deliver, I was gladly told that they would send someone to pick anything up in the neighborhood. Now, that I haven't seen in a hotel before. This place surprised me. The public areas are well designed and well-kept (although I didn not try the bar and restaurant), the rooms are classic SoHo, and the service is r e a l...all these factors make 60 Thompson an ideal bet, especially if you can get a rate under $200. If they charge you over $300-400, I'd really consider splurging ont the Mercer.
Dec 19 2005	It might be marvellous but there's something in the detail	Lovely quiet and well designed rooms (though the usual lack of attention to details - scuff marks on the walls, stains on carpets and furnishings - so hey everyone, there's a business here for hotel detailing because so few places do it!), excellent service and a great location. But for the price, you would expect that rooms would be pristine.
Dec 16 2005	So-So in SOHO	In a city where you can $100 a night for a bunk bed, value for money is always pot luck in New York. Yet we still had high hopes when we decided to splash out on a $500 room at 60 Thompson for our weekend away. Entering the lobby we were greeted by a mysterious smell that seemed to be a mixture of body odour and alcohol that may have wafted in from the hotel bar. At check-in, the staff were extremely friendly, courteous and welcoming as we were informed that due to a number of late check-outs that our room wasn't ready, but a complimentary drink kept us happy during the half hour wait.Our room was a superior queen located on the 3rd floor, which although very clean and well-maintained, was very cosy. It was also not that well insulated as we later found out when the DJ started in the bar directly below us. The heating/cooling problem often mentioned in other reviews was also apparent with a delicate balance being struck with a partially opened window to avoid dehydration.We both sampled from the room service menu throughout the stay and while the food from the in-house restaurant was very nice, we were shocked to find that after adding an 18% gratuity and a $3 delivery charge the bill still had space left for our own tip, something I have never experienced in any other hotel I have visited. After spending $500 per night, we were also surprised that breakfast was an extra and the novelty of a Dean &amp; Deluca stocked minibar certainly wears off when you could walk two blocks to the actual store and pay half the price.60 Thompson is a sleek hotel, in a great SOHO location with very friendly staff, however when it comes to value for money it left a lot to be desired.
Dec 16 2005	One night's stay	Stayed one cold night in December. Room was nice and well decorated with a fancy shower but no tub. Lobby and bar were really nice, the room came close but was relatively small and unfortunately was supposed to be non-smoking but from the burns on the floor and the smell on the phone was obviously for smoking. A bit noisy too, caused by an adjacent occupant. Overall, pretty good.
Dec 14 2005	Cool Thompson	Just returned from a 4 night stay, arrived to find a full on Vogue photo-shoot taking place - it's that sort of place!! Our room on the 12th floor was well proportioned and was quiet, our only criticism was that we only had a shower, unfortunately no bath.Whilst the Thompson has a cool vibe it is not a cold unwelcoming place, the staff are friendly and the service was particularly good in the Thom Bar. We had previuosly stayed in large uptown hotels, this is the complete opposite - we loved exploring SOHO and surrounding areas. PS A few doors up from the hotel is the Thompson Cafe(not related to hotel), it is small, quaint and great for a latte, breakfast or a light lunch.
Nov 25 2005	Outstanding!!	My wife and i recently stayed at the property(albeit one night). It was recommended by a friend and we were glad we did. From the time of our EARLY check-in on a Saturday during a busy weekend in late November to the time of checkout, everything was wonderful. I found the staff to be over-the-top nice, and considering my MANY trips to the city, I found it most unusual. I dont think we ever touched a bag or opened a door the ENTIRE time. They also proceeded to send us up a comp. chilled bottle of FINE sake. And about an hour later a chilled comp. bottle of Vos water, and about the time we were talking about that, there came ANOTHER knock at the door with some amazing sweets and a menu of their restaurant (definately a must try). So anyone related to 60 Thompson reading this....GREAT JOB!......we WILL return.P.S Thanks Martin
Nov 24 2005	Average	Lots of positives - bathrooms are fantastic, staff were very, very helpful, bar was great, free wireless and a great location. But we had problems with the aircon as it has been switched off for the Fall and Winter but we were staying in early November during a very warm spell. For one night, it was too hot to sleep and we were considering checking out. It was only after we (and others) complained enough times that the aircon was switched back on. The room was also very small and painted beige, so it didn't look a lot different to a cheap motel room. The walls were also very thin. Another disappointment was the roof top bar which is closed for the Fall and the Winter, even though the weather was very warm.
Nov 3 2005	a gem!...	Just had a quick trip to NYC, busy with appointments, rendezvous and shopping....found 60 Thompson to be a wonderful oasis. It has a calm and quiet feel in a bustling neighbourhood, with great restaurants and shops in abundance just steps away...love the area!The staff, fom beginning to end were friendly, helpful and ever-smiling.....didn't see a bit of the &quot;too cool&quot; commented on in another review.We were more than pleasantly surpised by an upgrade to a luxurious suite, with a terrace with breathtaking views....I can't comment on other rooms/sizes etc..... but must say that this was beautifully appointed,spare but comfortable. I would assume that all bathrooms have the same lovely products, good and plentiful towels, thick robes....bed linens by Frette. There were gorgeous fresh flowers throughout the suite....and I saw a cart in the hallway,filled with vases of fresh orchids, making deliveries to other rooms.Room service was prompt on one occasion and rather slow on another, but staff were extremely apologetic....busy breakfast hour. The appetizers available from their restaurant were delicious,unusual and arrived piping hot and nicely presented....breakfast was more on the ordinary side, but fresh and again nicely presented.I'd happily stay here again!
Oct 18 2005	Very pleasant!	We just returned from a 5 day stay at 60 Thompson and we loved it ! Our deluxe king room was quite spacious, nicely furnished and had an incredibly comfortable bed. Staff was extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. We had dinner twice in our room and once at Kittichai and the dishes were always delicious. All in all, everything was perfect. But when I pay 480 $/night, this is also what I expect. 60 Thompson is a really great place to stay downtown (better than the Mercer where we stayed last year).
Aug 24 2005	A Great Experience	We just returned from a 5 day break at 60 Thompson. Last year we stayed at the Hudson where I can testify that the rooms are really, really small. You coudn't swing a cat in them let alone store your luggage! You get what you pay for I know but the rooms at 60 Thompson were great (We paid $290 dollars a night). Rooms were large, spacious with a great bathroom - all in all a pleasure to stay in. The location of the hotel couldn't be better for being in the heart of it and wandering around trying all the local bars, restaurants and shopping without having to rely on cabs or the subway. I also thought the decor was in line with what you would expect of a luxury 4* plus hotel. It was very tastefully furnished in a dark wood/oriental style with great design touches such as the 60's Ericofons everywhere and gorgeous floral displays. We had plenty of Mojitos in Thom's Bar and up on the roof terrace as the weather was HOT. We also dined at Kittichai more than once - the monkfish curry was amazing! All in all the service was great and friendly enough for us. The only downside I thought was that because the general public visit the bars as much as the residents, on 2 or 3 nights of our stay the roof terrace and/or Thom's Bar were closed for Private Parties leaving hotel guests to sit and drink in the foyer. They may have opened up later but we didn't wait around to find out. All in all though, a great place in the heart of Soho and I would recommend a short break here.
Aug 23 2005	Cool Calm and Collected	If you want to stay downtown but apart from Wall Street, you do not have many choices. 60 Thompson is one of the best. Located in the heart of Soho, but on a fairly quiet street, this hotel gives you a certain &quot;zen&quot; hotel experience. The rooms are designed with panache, and the bar and restaurant have become local scenes. The service, while somewhat aloof, is very professional and competent. 60 Thompson is an excellent downtown hotel experience especially if you want to hang with the Euro hip.
Aug 2 2005	Had a GREAT stay. Not perfect but great.	My wife and I had an excellent 3 day stay at 60 Thompson. We paid a rate of $279/night via Quickbook, and got every penny's worth.The front desk staff was bright and friendly...the concierge cheerful and well informed...and the bell staff prompt and efficient.The first 2 days were practically flawless.Our room was just as hip and stylish as you'd expect in a hotel of this flavor...and was roomy by NY standards (just about the size of a 'regular' room in most areas of the country). The bed and linens were outstanding! The bathroom was spacious, clean, and well appointed.We made a quick trip up to the rooftop bar, which was very vibey with a nice view. We didn't eat at the hotel's Thai restaurant, but it was packed nightly with quite a posh crowd.Arguably, the Thompson's best attribute is it's location! We love Soho, and the Thompson is steps away from anything and everything of interest in the area (Noho/Nolita/Greenwich Village/Canal St/Little Italy/Chinatown), yet feels slightly removed from all the hustle and bustle.There was really only one negative in our 60 Thompson experience. On our last morning there, we woke up to an inordinate amount of banging and clanging by the housekeeping staff. This was at about 8:30am. We were annoyed, but it didn't significantly taint our overall experience.60 Thompson has definitely become our Soho headquarters, and we're looking forward to our next stay!
Jul 28 2005 	Great boutique hotel	Recently stayed at 60 Thompson for business and pleasure. It is well located in Soho and my room was more than adequate. Dinner at the hotel's restaurant was delicious and provided great people watching. I found the staff throughout the hotel to be quite friendly and helpful. The only reason I did not rate this as an &quot;Excellent&quot; hotel is that it has no business center at all. Also, my room did not have a tub. Between the Soho Grand and 60 Thompson, I would choose whichever hotel gives you a better price; they are both great hotels.
Jun 29 2005	A complete disappointment	Our 3 day stay was to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and to round off a 2 week stay in the USA. Feel utterly ripped off and totally regret choosing the hotel. The only positive thing we felt about it was the location, which was fantastic.Issue 1:Took ages to check in, a very luke warm welcome. We'd been so excited about staying there and this reception dampened our spirits somewhat.Issue 2: We decided to splash out and stay in one of the so-called larger rooms at $500 per night, which was one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in. We had to store our suitcases elsewhere as they wouldn't fit in the room. That was after the wrong cases were delivered to our room...Issue 3: Very hot room, which was confusing as the hotel had air-conditioning. We had to phone down and ask someone why it was so hot. &quot;oh yeah, that's because the air com system has blown out, it might be fixed later..&quot; Interesting that no-one had told us this when we checked in. The air con started working about 6 hours later.Issue 4: This is a big one, and one which we pointed out to the staff. On our second day we waited about 5 minutes for the elevator to take us from the 9th floor to street level. Giving up on waiting we decided to walk down the fire escape, which wasn't a big problem until we hit the 2nd floor and could go no further as there was a pile of furniture blocking our path. Undeterred we walked back up a floor and found another fire escape on the other side of the building. Alas, on the 2nd floor this was stacked up with crates. Which we had to lift up and move to get out. Really glad there wasn't a fire or we would have all been in trouble. The hotel were acting illegally by blocking these fire escapes and I was disgusted by their lack of consideration for guests. Issue 5:Just a general note on the tedious staff and their 'too cool for school' attitude, got very boring after a while and made our stay uncomfortable We had a fantastic time in NY, but felt absolutely ripped off, we paid $500 per night and had a thoroughly annoying experience. It's not even that exciting as a 'style hotel', and we're stayed at enough of these in our time to have a pretty good benchmark.
Jun 28 2005	Impressed	Great little hotel on a quiet street in Soho. Gorgeous room, got upgraded to a King. Bathroom sumptuous and slick. Great view, both in the room and via the skyline cam on the flatscreen TV. Staff, with the exception of just one chilly front desk clerk, was friendly and helpful. Rooftop bar was gorgeous and fun. Only one negative: very loud toilets. Irritating, day and especially night. I would stay there again, and plan to in the coming weeks.
Jun 15 2005	What a hotel	I read some reviews posted about this hotel before we left but after we had booked that almost made me want to cancel. Iï¿½M SO GLAD I DIDNï¿½T! This hotel is a hive of activity and the roof top bar / sun lounge is something to behold, but the guest rooms are only accessible via your room card so they stay safe and quiet. Location is great for soho and taxis are easy to come by to go ï¿½uptownï¿½. Coming from London and with the strong exchange rate the prices are acceptable and the staff are not rude (as I had read elsewhere) rather helpful and knowledgeable. In all a really great location if you donï¿½t want the hustle and bustle of staying on 5th and keeps the great atmosphere of soho.
Jun 13 2005	Nice but expensive	Just got back from a weekend at 60 Thompson. I was quite satisfied with the hotel, but I would not call it a great value. The entrance and lobby are lovely, but the rooms are very small. The sofa and chair look a little comical in such a small space. The location was great. Restaurant Barolo on the same block was fabulous!The concierge was very helpful. If $$ is no concern, I would recommend this.
May 25 2005	way overrated	My family stayed at 60 Thompson after hearing from everyone it was a great hotel and the best place to stay downtown, very chic and cool. Wow, we were sooo underwhelmed. Our rooms were tiny, with no amenities to speak of. The view of a brick wall was less than stunning, and the comfort level all in all, average at best. I had stayed at the Gaansevort a year ago and would recommend it over 60 Thompson. One day my daughter and I were asked to leave the lobby at 6pm because there was a private party. We couldn't go in the lobby! The staff was nice, that is the only thing about the hotel that was good. I guess if I was Russell Crowe, I could get a great room.  I can't tell you enough how uncool this cool hotel is.
May 17 2005	a sanctuary in the city	From the moment you pull up to the entrance of 60 thompson you know you will not be disappointed. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly and professional doorman.The entrance can be a little confusing because there are 2 lobbies. The ground floor had these lovely fragrant votive candles. The young lady who greeted us here was also very polite and directed us to the &quot;check-in&quot; lobby located one floor up. The room itself was heavenly. If you are used to NY standards with regards to space then you will not be disappointed. If you are someone who loves large rooms, then you may want to find another hotel. We found the room sufficient. It was a King superior room, which we got for $175/night - a total steal! The only down side was that the roof top lounge was not open because the weather was not warm enough and there were some renovations taking place. None of which bothered us at all.Also the bathroom was spectacular - even took digital pictures of it so I could redo my own personal restroom at home.The lounge down stairs was also very nice. It was very mellow, more of either a pre or post party place to have a drink.For a place that was so trendy it had no attitude problem, like most of the other NY hotels. (The front desk staff brought me a new toothbrush when i told them i forgot mine.) They were also helpful in recommending a nice massage parlour and made the booking themselves.Besides all that, the hotel is located in the best part of the city. I have lived in Manhattan and if I could ever afford it, I would live in Soho! It is close to lots of restaurants and boutiques. And it's just a beautiful area to walk around. If you have never been to NY then this place will give you the best opinion of the city.You can't go wrong with this place - seriously.
May 3 2005	Excellent location great Hotel	After an initial mix up on arrival, they only had us booked for one night and seemed fairly adamant on having us stay for 1 night, despite our email confirmation for 3 nights (from Jan 2005), we were then given the wrong room (2 beds, slightly smaller than doubles), the assistant manager, arranged our booked room, a King Deluxe for the following 2 nights, deducted $100 off our bill and sent up a bottle of champagne to our room, a nice touch, although we would have rather had it right from the start, the bar is a really cool place to be, and the restaurant looks nice, although we didn't eat there. the location is fantastic, a great place to be for shopping, site seeing, drinking and eating. 10/10 in our opinion.
Mar 14 2005	Great place	I took my wife on a surprise long weekend away to New York for our first wedding anniversary, and so wanted something pretty special. I did a lot of research into hotels/areas and agonised for ages about where to stay. Despite its mixed reviews, I finally settled on 60 Thompson. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. It was our first trip to NYC and a New Yorker friend of mine had urged me to stay in SoHo. This was great advice as the area was fantastic - brilliant atmosphere, excellent shopping, etc. You can walk up to all the tourist spots, but then retreat to the calm of SoHo. I would strongly recommend SoHo to anyone visiting NYC.As I was sitting in the cab from JFK to Manhattan, I was getting a little nervous about the hotel.........after all the mixed reviews about the staff, etc. However, the reception staff could not have been more helpful (yes, they're all great looking, but no harm in that!). Ditto for all the staff - very friendly, helpful and professional. Having been there, I'm really surprised by the comments in other reviews.The hotel design is very cool, but actually really cosy/intimate. Much more intimate than SoHo Grand, where we went for drinks one night. The room was very good, although oddly, there was about an inch gap between the carpet and the door to the room - same applied to all the other rooms. We eventually put one of our bathrobes on the floor to block out the light from the corridor!Anyway, we really enjoyed out stay and would certainly recommend.
Feb 21 2005	Bizarre service	Stayed for 3 night here in a King Deluxe in February 2005. First some positives. Fantastic location in the heart of soho. Round the corner from great shops, cafes and restaurants. The hotel's design is great, and our room was very nice. We got a special offer through quikbook, and paid $250 per night, which was good value in my view. We ate in the bar one night, and the food was very good. Ate from the thai tapas menu, and although pricey, the food was very nice. Despite the quality of the room, and the hotel in general, the staff are really quite unique. My first experience of the 60's staff was when the bell boy carried our bags to our room. I tipped him $10, he said thanks, and he left. So far so good. Within ten minutes, i had reason to go downstairs, where I bumped into the guy holding my $10. I said &quot;how are you&quot;? to which he replied by looking at me as if I had ------ in his cornflakes. You may think he didn't hear me, but I can assure you, he was right next to me, and heard loud and clear. The point I'm trying to make, is that the staff at this hotel have so much attitude, it's unreal. The guys on the door show little interest in opening doors. The reception staff can't even bring themselves to raise their eyes to speak to you, prefering to conduct a conversation whist looking at their computer. It's strange this, as they were quick to respond to other requests. For example I asked for an adoptor to charge my phone and they were very prompt. It seems to be only in face to face discussions, that they disgrace themselves.A genuinely bizarre experience dealing with the staff here. A great hotel, hence the high review mark, but try to enjoy it without interacting with the staff.
Feb 21 2005 	Not Quite There	Usually stay at the Soho Grand around the corner, but tried this place because of the location and web site, that promised similar lodgings.Good points: - free broadband internet - all-marble bath with nice marble shower stall - nice room layout, even in smallest room, with sofa - 24 hour room service - DVD player Bad points: - DVD player did not work - called housekeeping at 10:45am to clean room, showed at 1:30pm - no rental movies on TV, hotel DVD's rent for $10/day - elevator requires room key for access - room A/C did not work (but the windows open...) You can get the &quot;60 Thompson&quot; experience by sitting in the radiant heated bar outside - that is when it's open. Still, 60 Thompson is better than most Midtown hotels, if only for the location.
Feb 1 2005	I Love 60 Thompson	I can't imagine anyone not liking this hotel. I stayed at 60 Thompson in a deluxe king from Thurs. to Sun. and had the most incredible weekend in New York. The staff is as nice as can be. Whatever I requested throughout the weekend was delivered in moments. THE CONCIERGE AT THOMPSON IS THE BEST! They setup our entire weekend. From dinner on Friday, hair cut Sat., Dinner Sat., and a night out for 18 people at one of the most exclusive lounges in NYC. Everything went off without a hitch. The rooms were beautiful. Walk to great shopping in SoHo. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that Thom's is slow as molases. Room service was very fast, though. Eat brunch at the Cupping Room, a block away. There was barely any street noise on the 12th floor and the room was a great size for New York. If you're planning a night out on the town with friends this is the spot. The concierge will get you into any restaurant, club, or lounge that you want. The rooms and bathrooms are beautiful.
Jan 22 2005	Depends on the room you get	My boss and I just completed a three day stay at 60 Thompson. We got corporate rates of $250. I received room 59 upon check-in and it is not at all a special room -- standard NY crunch. There was no desk, although there was a long rectangular table nested under a higher, square table that served as a nightstand, so I pulled out the long rectangular table and used it as a desk, when I was either sitting on the couch or the large lounge chair. If you have need of back support to do any work, this won't work well for you. Unfortunately, pulling that table out took up most of the remaining available footprint. Two people can't walk past each other at the same spot in this room. When I arrived in room 59, there was no shampoo (although there were other amenities), the phone didn't work and no flower in the vase (supposed to be an orchid in a little square glass vase with pebbles). I didn't realize this until turndown service came and filled my ice bucket, at which point I tipped $2 -- then the service rep graciously noted that my flower was missing and brought me one. In my opinion, even the corporate rate of $250 was just a bit much for this room -- a fairer price would be under $200. My boss' experience was different -- when he went to check in, they informed him there was no room for him even though he had a guaranteed reservation. However, they did offer to pay to put him up at the Soho Grand that night and the next night, they appear to have upgraded him to a much larger suite, Room 100, which they comp'd (this must be what is normally the $400/night room. It was nice of them to comp him, but then he was really quite upset that the reservation hadn't been honored). This is a truly large room, with a separate sleeping area and an enormous entertaining space with a ponyskin area rug. There is a proper desk, two TVs (one of them flat screen LCD) and two bathrooms. Cookies were in the room as part of the suite service. Amenities in both rooms were by Fresh. Suite Room 100 had a wood floor. Standard Room 59 had carpeting. Both rooms had king beds. The service, as has been noted elsewhere, was exceptional (despite my boss not getting a room on his guaranteed reservation and with the exception of turndown service, who I suspect might not have offered me that flower until the tip was forthcoming -- but at least the tip urged an offer of a flower). Room service was exceedingly polite, intelligent and thoughtful. As has been noted elsewhere, the neighborhood is choice. The weather in NY was sub-zero, so we walked two and a half blocks turning right out of the hotel and found this little basement Cubana restaurant (called, I think, the Cubana Cafe or something like that) at which was the best grilled corn with hot spice and cheese and ethereally fresh chicken soup. Available for a song and delectable (and hot!)Overall, I'm torn as to whether to stay again (I don't think I would want a room like 59 at $250 again, but nor do I think it would be fair to get a room like 100 at the price of $250 -- if only they had something in between!).
Jan 17 2005	excellent	just got back from nyc after having stayed at 60 thompson for 5 nights. i must say that the hotel, the staff, the restaurant, the location, the concierge, the room - all was top notch. if you can stretch to a superior room (pay about $350) then do it, as the smaller rooms are definately too small for anything more than an overnight stay. thompson street is well placed for great vibes, bars, restaurants &amp; cool shops. i thought that $ 18 for two cups of coffee was a bit off a liberty, so go eleswhere for that kind of stuff. overall, however, i found 60 thompson to be spot on.
Dec 29 2004	Very pleased	King deluxe room was large and very comfortable with excellent bathroom and great Fresh bath amenities. Service was very pleasant and professional and location was great. Would definitely stay here again.
Dec 25 2004	Disappointing	Stayed here in November. Friends rave about it but I had a bad stay. It has some problems. You cannot use any a/c despite hot rooms because they have turned it off - only in guest rooms though! Glasses in the bar are dirty. Barman when I was there failed to make an acceptable vodka tonic three times consecutively - he made it with soda water and mineral water on two of those occasions. Rooms are small. Service is haphazard but the concerge was pretty helpful. Aims to please and in a good area but is losing oiut to the competition. My analysis may sound trivial but this hotel must try much harder.
Dec 4 2004	Nice Touches Great Location Wonderful Service	The 60 Thompson was my place of residence for a couple days on business this last week. I arrived on Sunday at 11:30 and had to wait till about 2:30 for my room to be available. Right after Thanksgiving and they were packed. While waiting I asked where I could get something to eat and was pointed to the ï¿½Country Cafeï¿½ practically right across the street. OUTSTANDING!!Comments about 60 Thompson: Service was excellent from the bellhop to the service engineer when my bathtub stopper quit working. In minutes it was fixed. Desk Personnel and Restaurant Servers were exceptional.My room was a King Deluxe, facing the front street. Room size was good enough, sofa and chair was a nice touch. Full bath, all marble was really beautiful! Towels and toiletries, nice! The only thing I missed as a women traveler was a make-up mirror that magnifies for putting on my makeup.Nice down comforters on beds and it really was a nice touch when they brought me awesome cookies late in the afternoon. Room service was quick and the restaurant food, above average. Thai Food!!Thereï¿½s only two things I found unappealing about the hotel. One, the walls could use cleaning in the lobby areas where peoples luggage and hands, etc have been abusing the area. A good cleaning necessary. Two, the walls are thin and the toilets flush VERY loudly, I laughed the first time I flushed. The street isnï¿½t too busy, so it isnï¿½t too noisy, but if youï¿½re a light sleeper, you might want to bring some earplugs with you just in case.The hotel really isnï¿½t luxurious, but I think itï¿½s above average compared to many NY hotels.If you like a modern, arï¿½sy decor, than this is your hotel and the location in SoHo is perfect for browsing the areas shops. Do check out the Country Cafe though, superb service, coffee and plenty of food.
Nov 6 2004	Promoted as great reality is that it is average!	I recently stayed for 3 nights at 60 Thomson. I really put some effort in to choosing this hotel for our stay since it was a special occasion. Our room was on the 9th floor on a corner. I though it was pretty small. I expected it to be a little bigger, especially since it was a new building. The bath was small too. The &quot;Fresh&quot; brand toiletries were a surprise since the website advertized &quot;Philosophy&quot; toiletries. Anyway, the shower/tub combo was ok, although the water pressure was great! Sheets were very comfortable. We ordered breakfast via the door knob form one night. In the morning the food arrived and we were still asleep. When they came to pick up the tray an hour later they knocked and we were still asleep. Half awake I agreed when the room service attendant asked if he could heat up our eggs for us. I agreed and he returned a half hour later. I got a surprise when I checked out, he charged us double for the entire meal. So my room service breakfast ended up being $162 dollars. Anyway I wouldn't have agreed to the perceived &quot;re-heat&quot; if I knew I was being charged for a whole new breakfast!Overall, Average to good rating. Room was small for a newly constructed building and the bar on the roof was so small and overcrowded that it was hard to enjoy!!!
Oct 28 2004	Location Location Location	The best thing going for this hotel is it's SOHO location. Front desk staff were pretentious. We arrived at 4:30 PM, they told us our room would be ready at 5:00, but it wasn't ready until 6 PM! We asked for an upper floor but we were told that the upper floor is noisy due to the roof top bar, only to find out that the roof top bar was CLOSED for the season. We ended up on the 6th floor with a view of the alley and building next door. Furnishings are cheap and flimsy. There is no desk area. The industrial strength toilet seemed out of place in an otherwise nicely appointed bathroom. AND the toilet was so loud and powerful that we wondered if we were going to get flushed down with it. Walls are paper thin. On a more positive note, the rooms were sufficient in size for NY, beds were comfortable, sheets were oh so soft, the restaurant's decor was quite impressive with an awesome lilly pond, the candlelit lobby added a nice ambience and the bellmen were really nice. And of course, you can't beat the SOHO location. For less than $200/night I might recommend this hotel. However, due to the lack of customer service and the lack of amenities, for what we paid ($385 from Quickbook for a room with two queen beds) this hotel was a big disappointment and we considered it way over priced.
Oct 7 2004	Ultra-posh good experience	Although there were some mixed reviews about 60 Thompson on this site, we booked a King Supreme room to house my family of 4 for 5 days (2 adults, one infant, one 2 year old.)The hotel is over the top posh, but the service(contrary to prior posts) was excellent. Despite being a dominantly upwardly mobile single crowd staying there, we still felt some warmth both from the staff and patrons. When our baby girl cried for hours on early morning, we received a call/complaint that was very understanding. We can't blame the neighbors for complaining- she does cry quite loudly. The location is fantastic, especially if you aren't doing the whole midtown tourist thing. Soho is great for shopping. There are tons of great restaurants in the neighborhood. And after walking around NYC day after day, the hotel provided a satisfying respite.The hotel looks good, but some of the furniture in the rooms show a bit of wear- inevitable. I think we even caused some 'wear' ourselves. Positive experience for us. We would be happy to go back.
Sep 30 2004 	Great Location	Great location for Soho, Greenwich, Chelsea area shopping &amp; restaurants. Fun &amp; happening hotel &amp; bar for 20 &amp; 30 something crowd. Cool lobby. However - overpriced, lacked a certain &quot;polish&quot;; AND... we left our room for two hours in the morning of last day to return &amp; find an unmistakable intrusion. Someone had used the restroom (toilet seat up) &amp; stepped into the tub/shower with black soot on their shoes. Several items had been obviously moved in the drawer but nothing taken - to our knowledge. A bit unsettling for two women. Would not return.
Sep 30 2004	Down on 60 Thompson	Great Location, cool rooms then it all goes downhill from there. If you want any attention from the front desk staff do not stay at 60 Thompson. If you want to control your room temperature do not stay at 60 Thompson. If you want a hotel that listens to their guest when there are problems... do not stay at 60 Thompson. Our room was about 95 degrees and could not cool down (it was a November stay). We were told to open our window--ever stay in a NY hotel room with an open windw? Might as well sleep on the street. The front desk staff could not care less about the issue (nor the same problem when the person in front of us on the checkout line complained about the same problem). Even a letter to the hotel manager met with no repsonse. The bar is cool and the staff at the door are nice, but you are better served at the Mercer, Soho/Tribecca Grand or any of the W Hotels where they actually care about giving you a good stay.
Sep 28 2004	Wanted to like 60 Thompson - but just could not.	I wanted so much to like 60 Thompson. The service was pretty good, and the Kittichai restaurant was really great. And the real standout is the rooftop bar. But for the money - and you'll spend a great deal of money - this hotel just does not live up to the promise. The room we were in was so loud at all hours. Even hushed conversations were easily heard through the walls. And when we complained that we would like a room that was more quiet - well lets just say that it was made clear that our $350 a night was not enough to be placed in a more comfortable room.We booked an upgraded room - as you can see from my nightly rate versus others on this thread of reviews. But we were next to an elevator, above the kitchen, and next to a service room. Loud loud loud.The Soho Grand is just around the corner from 60 Thompson and is just as hip without as much attitude and definitely a better room. So save the extra $125 a night.
Sep 25 2004	You pays your money and......	I dont know what people expect of NYC hotels. Im English and can see through a thin veneer of Boutique -chic. The 60 T is fine you know what you are in for before you book so if you've got a ruck sack or are still in snow wash jeans ..Avoid this place. There are alot more hotels in town that I could name that are far more painful in the &quot; we think we are all that&quot; so we must be. Its fine fine fine here, just fine not wonderful just fine . I think the problem stems from peoples anticipation and expectations of a Jimmy Choo experience but want walmark prices. Get a room for under $200 and you will be pleased with this joint.. theres not much choice below Houston Street after all. If you pay $400 a night and then complain on this site well more fool you for paying the rate in the first place. Give the 60 T a break, I could vent my anger at some truly attrocious rip off joints.
Sep 20 2004	Great Location Nice Hotel but they need to work on the details	Here's a free flowing critique....I hate to be negative about it, especially for our great price of $190. night (it was supposed to be $400. and at that price would have been very disappointing), but they need to work on the details. We were not given shamoo bottles after the first day, but on the third (after asking) were given 5 of each. We asked for luggage racks when we arrived (so that we wouldn't have to put our suitcases on the floor), but after the bellman took the tip he didn't return with the goods. I love the details of boutique hotels but there wasn't much here. Though they did have a lot for sale in the room. They should provided complimentary shower caps, sewing kits, something more - it makes such a difference! They do provide cotton balls and qtips, which is nice. An framed art piece was hung half way behind the t.v. cabinet (what's that about!) That's too easy to fix! I'm a designer and that really bothered me. The Frette sheets were brand new, crisp and luxurious. The floor of the shower had a litle bit of black mold, but otherwise the bathroom was lovely. Great idea - towel bars stacked. Hotel is not child friendly, but we knew that already. There were three of us in the room, but they left one brownie on the pillow and we were fighting over it nightly! It's the details that are missing, you know? Otherwise, it is a simple, nicely designed, clean hotel in a great location, oh and I loved the lit candles in the lobby.
Aug 27 2004	Definitely not worth the money	DEFINITELY NOT worth the price. This small hotel is nice and minimally hip, in a great location(one of the few hotels in the midst of SOHO), but nothing special. There are many, many hipper and nicer hotels in NYC for a better price. The rooms are nice and spacious for NYC, but the basic amenities are missing. We had to request an iron and our toiletries were never replaced after the first day. We were there for a week, and even after multiple requests for shampoo, soap, etc., never received them. The hotel staff were nice and courteous. The bar on the roof, which everyone touts as &quot;fabulous&quot; was never open. Nothing seemed to ever be going on at 60 Thompson. We have been to NYC 10 times and are very well-traveled and enjoy boutique hotels, but I would never stay here again. If you're looking for hipness, stay at the &quot;W&quot; or Royalton. For the same price, you could also stay at the Waldorf Astoria and feel like your money was well-spent.
Aug 10 2004	Liked 60 Thompson A-LAH!!!!!	I stayed at 60 Thompson last weekend and was pleasantly surprised given some of the comments I've read here. To begin with, the location is great. There are many many fabulous restaurants (Kin Khao is awesome!!!!) within a few blocks, as well as wonderful shopping. The doormen and bell hops were extremely nice and helpful. It took a while to check in, but who cares? The lobby is a bit shabby. It does need new carpet and a new look overall...it looks better at night. We had a standard queen room on the 6th floor. The view was nothing great, but it wasn't bad either. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've had in a hotel (I've stayed in 6 different hotels in NYC in the past year so I'm getting good at judging these things :) . I don't know what some people's problem is with a duvet cover vs. a sheet. They wash the duvet cover just like they wash a sheet and put a new one on for each guest. It's really better....less to get all tangled up in. The size of the room is, well, small. But not as small as rooms at the Hudson. There's a bit more space to navigate. The bathroom is very nice...not terrific lighting for putting on makeup and the shower/tub is only big enough for one person, but it's all dark tile w/ white fixtures....very pretty. The shampoo and lotions are from Fresh and smell fab. I went to the Fresh store to buy them but too expensive!! The best thing about this hotel is the rooftop bar. There are very cozy couches up there, strong drinks, and a great view. It's open way late into the night and when everything else was dead it was hopping. Seemed to be a very international crowd at the hotel. I would definitely stay there again. It's also convenient for driving into and out of the city. The exit for the Holland Tunnel is 2 blocks away. Valet parking is $35/night. One note is that we paid $179/night for this hotel thru Expedia. I would not pay more than $200/night to stay here. If you can get it for $200 or less per night, my opinion is that it is a good deal.
Aug 9 2004	A SOHO Sweetspot	Need a hotel in SOHO at a reasonable price, with an outrageously courteous and helpful hotel staff, a rooftop bar and lounge with spectacular views of Wall Street and the Empire State Building, clean rooms, comfortable beds, quiet air conditioning that has controls that actually work, and great people watching? 60 Thompson is it. There are great eats and bars in the neighborhood and the art galleries are right around the corner. We'll definitely stay here again the next time the grandparents can watch the kids!
Jul 10 2004	Shabby and Grotesquely Overpriced	If you're looking for a luxury hotel, this is not for you! I selected the hotel for location and because it appeared to be a deluxe establishment. I picked a junior suite in order to entertain friends and have some living space. I was told it was 500 square feet, which is not large but should have been sufficient. Well, the room was substantially less than 500 square feet, with room for about 4 people only to sit comfortably. Worse yet, it was very cheaply decorated and horribly maintained. There were sticky drip marks on the front of the mini bar, the leather chair had slash marks on it, the cheap finishings (e.g., flourescent light tubes) were poorly done (e.g. cabinet doors did not fit properly together and the &quot;molding&quot; on the walls was unfinished, sloppily painted strips of wood).
Jul 10 2004	Fantastic stay!	Chic, understated luxury. We loved this property -- spacious room, sumptuous black marble bath with walk in shower and Fresh bath products. The continental breakfast, with fresh fruit, homemade granola, yoghurt, pastries, fresh orange juice, coffee, tea was delicious and reasonable. We arrived early, and the front desk was friendly and helpful, taking our cell number so that they could let us know when the room was ready while we were out shopping. Location is great, walkable to NYU, the Village, and good restaurants and shopping. And a lovely roof-top patio for sunbathing in day and a drink in the evening. We found a great rate at Quikbook.com. Anne-Laurent, from the executive office who acted as concierge, was always helpful. A perfect stay -- definitely a 5 star hotel.
Jul 1 2004 	Beautiful perfect chic	I feel fortunate to have been able to find an affordable rate that allowed me to stay one night at this utterly gorgeous hotel ($179 for a large queen room with large bathroom on our corporate travel agency's website instead of $400+).Every single detail in this hotel is lush and beautiful. From the elevators to the rooftop bar, the design is warm minimalist chic.The bathroom goodies - from Fresh - with Frette bathrobes - complement the beautiful dark marbled tile and fabulous power shower.The room comes with large TV (hidden, naturally), DVD player, CD player, and a bunch of fun items for purchase (T-shirts that say &quot;My boyfriend is out of town&quot;).Instead of a bureau, the room comes with a sleek sofa with velvet cushions.I just adore this place.Oh, and the staff are friendly and room service prompt.
Jun 22 2004	Great location A+ service!	After doing a fair bit of research, a friend and I selected 60 Thompson as our hotel of choice for a long weekend of shopping in NYC. We couldn't have selected a better hotel. We requested a room on high floor, and we were given a clean, quiet, spacious (by NYC standards) room with a great view. Our room fit 2 double beds easily, with ample space to get around without bumping into each other. We had absolutely no noise problems; I slept like a baby! I loved the turn-down service, complete with brownies, and the yummy bath products.Our every request was promptly answered, if not already thoughtfully provided for in advance. The beds did not have top-sheets - we requested top sheets, which were brought to us in less than 10 minutes by the courteous housekeeping staff, at 11 p.m. at night! We had a bit of a wait (40 minutes)for our room to be prepared when we were checking in, but the hotel offered us free drinks on the house, and held our luggage while we got an early start on our shopping. The rooftop bar and hotel lobby lounge were chic spots to get a drink after a long day of shopping, without being intrusive, noisy or overcrowded, like the &quot;social scene&quot; at some other hip NYC hotels.I can't say enough good things about this hotel. Finding a hotel that provides a great ambiance and good service is always a bit of a gamble in NYC, and this one paid off. I will definitely return to 60 Thompson on my next visit to NYC, and would readily recommend it to anyone looking for a gem of a hotel in the Soho/Greenwich village area.
Jun 13 2004	Great location good hotel	We were very pleased with our stay although I recognise some of the criticisms people mention. The rooms are a good size I think. Very little hanging space but good drawer space. The roof bar was great in on warm June nights with views uptown and downtown. All the staff were friendly and tried to be helpful. Some were professional, some playing enthusiastically with amateur status. No restaurant - a Thai one about to open and breakfast slow and dull while we were there - but plenty of places nearby for breakfast - try the Mercer! If you want to be in SoHo, a good place to stay.
May 11 2004	Lovely!	I recently flew to New York to celebrate my birthday with friends. The lobby, my room, lounge (and doormen) were all gorgeous. The front desk, very helpful. My linens, robe, towels etc. all new, sparkling clean and comfy. My stay at 60 Thompson ranks about the best experience I've had at a hotel. The restaurant was closed for renovation which allowed me to explore the neighborhood even more. Lovely!
May 3 2004	It stunk!	Although the hotel itself was hip &amp; fun and we luckily didn't have a problem with loud neighbors, our recent two-night stay was ruined by the fact our room smelled like stale cigarette smoke the whole time we were there. At a certain point, it even smelled in the hallway outside our door. The front desk insisted we were on a non-smoking floor each time we complained, but who cares! It still smelled. They couldn't switch us the first night because the hotel was booked and the 2nd night there were no rooms available equal to what we already had. They did offer to put an ionizer in the room while we were at dinner and it did seem to help initially, but the smell was back again by the next morning. Although the room decor was sleek, the room overall seemed a little beat up. The bathroom wasn't anything that great either. Our king bed also seemed short and I'm not a tall person. The doormen were good but because the front desk did not really seem to care about our complaint, we were overall disappointed with service. Our smelly room interfered with what otherwise was a great time in NYC.
Apr 12 2004	60 Thompson made our visit to NYC!	My husband and I stayed at the 60 Thompson for seven nights in February 2004 on our first visit to New York City. We loved it! The room, on the 10th floor, was fantastic - comfy bed, excellent bathroom and a great view across Soho. The room was a comfortable size - we had a friend visit and there was more than enough room for three people to sit around. The turndown service - STILL water and Fat Witch brownies - was a treat. The staff, particularly those on the front desk and the bellboys, were always friendly and didn't show any attitude (though they looked really cool!). The location was superb! We loved Soho and there were some great restaurants near the hotel (try the small little Greek restaurant on Thompson Street, just up the road from the hotel - YUM!). We stayed at 60 Thompson during NYC Fashion Week so there were lots of beautiful people around the hotel (including a fashion shoot in the lobby), but that just made our stay more interesting. After we left NYC, we spent a month traveling around the US (including Boston, Washington DC, New Orleans, Vegas, SF and LA) and stayed in similar style and standard hotels and 60 Thompson was definitely the best. Don't listen to the people who have posted negative comments about this hotel - it's not true! One final comment -we got a great rate through Quikbook (used them for stays in other States and the rates were always the best and the rooms were always exceptional). Enjoy your stay at 60 Thompson - it really made our visit to NYC even more memorable!
Mar 26 2004	Ruined our vacation	NEVER AGAIN!!! Although the rooms were nicely decorated, the rest of the experience was substandard. Service could not be worse. Black bathrooms with no light. Neighboring rooms had parties going on all around us til dawn. No topsheets on the bed - just a duvet (skeevy!). Tons of Euro-trash and bridge and tunnel wanna-bes prevented us from enjoyed all common areas of the hotel after 8:00 pm. If you are as clueless to think that all of this spells C-O-O-L this is the place for you!
Mar 12 2004	Beautiful! Can't wait to stay again.	This is THE hotel for all you fabulously modern hip people. You can easily pass by the building it self because the exterior is quite serene and not as flashy as other boutique hotels. The bottom floor is the concierge, plush wall seating and elevators. The main &quot;lobby&quot; is on the second floor, where the registration desk and the Thom Bar are situated. Down to their Nino Cerruti uniforms, 60 Thompson was stylish and oh so pleasing to the eye. The people in the front desks looked like they were from the Elite and Ford Model Agencies. YUMMMYYY! Once you get up to the room, it's designed for the Architectural Digest crowd: Frette linens, huge suede headboard, 2 dark mahogany sidetables, toiletries from Fresh that included the best smelling Soy Shampoo, Pomegranate Conditioner, Lychee lotion. They even provide you with the 1 thing I ALWAYS forget to pack: Q-Tips! Something as trivial as that made me a fan of the hotel. The bathrooms were chocolate-colored marble up and down, east to west. The 2 shower heads were quite refreshing. The robes were very comfortable. The DVD player, nighttime brownie, and the friendliness of the staff, as well as everything I mentioned made 60 Thompson one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at.
Mar 8 2004	Great!!	As frequent visitors to NYC, over the years we have migrated down to lower NY after years of staying in midtown botique hotels (Royalton, Morgans, Hudson etc.) The Soho Grand is great, but the rooms are a little small. 60 Thompson is an oasis. The staff was super, the room was large, and the location cannot be beat. Their restaurant, Thom, was closed for renovations. We are looking forward to our next stay at 60 Thompson, and the re-opening of the restaurant alone will probably be worth the trip. If you want top notch service, along with a &quot;private apartment&quot;feel, this is the place. We cannot say enough good things!
Mar 2 2004	Service was disappointing - location great	Stayed for two nights Feb. 15 to th e 17th 2004 with my daughter. Room was small and disappointing. Bathroom was nice, marble and fun. Found the staff to be quite aloof. The concierge sent me to a spa that was closed. The breakfast was horrible and pricey. After I checked out, my credit card was billed for a second amount that was never shown to me. Numerous calls to the hotel were not responded to. The mini-bar was not stocked completely, and then I was charged for food and drinks that I did not use. The only good thing about this hotel is its location which is great.
Feb 11 2004	Pricey but great.	I rented a jr. suite for a saturday night as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday. The location was perfect, a block away from dinner and the bar we went to. The room was not huge, but it was big enough to have about 6-8 people back to after the bar(with some furniture rearanged). The bed was great! The bathroom was nice, seperate tub, but wasnt anything too special. Overall my experience was great, and would recomend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in Soho, not afraid to spend a little money.
Jan 20 2004	Worth your time!
Jan 18 2004	If you are a party person this is the right place.
Jan 10 2004	may be hip but definitely uncool
Dec 31 2003	Great for families too!
Nov 29 2003	Finally - Well-managed Hipness
Aug 28 2003	A cool place perfect located in Soho
